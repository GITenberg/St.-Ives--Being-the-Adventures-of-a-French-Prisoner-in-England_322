<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;A TALE OF A LION RAMPANT</h2>
<p>It was in the month of May 1813 that I was so unlucky as to
fall at last into the hands of the enemy.&nbsp; My knowledge of
the English language had marked me out for a certain
employment.&nbsp; Though I cannot conceive a soldier refusing to
incur the risk, yet to be hanged for a spy is a disgusting
business; and I was relieved to be held a prisoner of war.&nbsp;
Into the Castle of Edinburgh, standing in the midst of that city
on the summit of an extraordinary rock, I was cast with several
hundred fellow-sufferers, all privates like myself, and the more
part of them, by an accident, very ignorant, plain fellows.&nbsp;
My English, which had brought me into that scrape, now helped me
very materially to bear it.&nbsp; I had a thousand
advantages.&nbsp; I was often called to play the part of an
interpreter, whether of orders or complaints, and thus brought in
relations, sometimes of mirth, sometimes almost of friendship,
with the officers in charge.&nbsp; A young lieutenant singled me
out to be his adversary at chess, a game in which I was extremely
proficient, and would reward me for my gambits with excellent
cigars.&nbsp; The major of the battalion took lessons of French
from me while at breakfast, and was sometimes so obliging as to
have me join him at the meal.&nbsp; Chevenix was his name.&nbsp;
He was stiff as a drum-major and selfish as an Englishman, but a
fairly conscientious pupil and a fairly upright man.&nbsp; Little
did I suppose that his ramrod body and frozen face would, in the
end, step in between me and all my dearest wishes; that upon this
precise, regular, icy soldier-man my fortunes should so nearly
shipwreck!&nbsp; I never liked, but yet I trusted him; and though
it may seem but a trifle, I found his snuff-box with the bean in
it come very welcome.</p>
<p>For it is strange how grown men and seasoned soldiers can go
back in life; so that after but a little while in prison, which
is after all the next thing to being in the nursery, they grow
absorbed in the most pitiful, childish interests, and a sugar
biscuit or a pinch of snuff become things to follow after and
scheme for!</p>
<p>We made but a poor show of prisoners.&nbsp; The officers had
been all offered their parole, and had taken it.&nbsp; They lived
mostly in suburbs of the city, lodging with modest families, and
enjoyed their freedom and supported the almost continual evil
tidings of the Emperor as best they might.&nbsp; It chanced I was
the only gentleman among the privates who remained.&nbsp; A great
part were ignorant Italians, of a regiment that had suffered
heavily in Catalonia.&nbsp; The rest were mere diggers of the
soil, treaders of grapes or hewers of wood, who had been suddenly
and violently preferred to the glorious state of soldiers.&nbsp;
We had but the one interest in common: each of us who had any
skill with his fingers passed the hours of his captivity in the
making of little toys and <i>articles of Paris</i>; and the
prison was daily visited at certain hours by a concourse of
people of the country, come to exult over our distress,
or&mdash;it is more tolerant to suppose&mdash;their own vicarious
triumph.&nbsp; Some moved among us with a decency of shame or
sympathy.&nbsp; Others were the most offensive personages in the
world, gaped at us as if we had been baboons, sought to
evangelise us to their rustic, northern religion, as though we
had been savages, or tortured us with intelligence of disasters
to the arms of France.&nbsp; Good, bad, and indifferent, there
was one alleviation to the annoyance of these visitors; for it
was the practice of almost all to purchase some specimen of our
rude handiwork.&nbsp; This led, amongst the prisoners, to a
strong spirit of competition.&nbsp; Some were neat of hand, and
(the genius of the French being always distinguished) could place
upon sale little miracles of dexterity and taste.&nbsp; Some had
a more engaging appearance; fine features were found to do as
well as fine merchandise, and an air of youth in particular (as
it appealed to the sentiment of pity in our visitors) to be a
source of profit.&nbsp; Others again enjoyed some acquaintance
with the language, and were able to recommend the more agreeably
to purchasers such trifles as they had to sell.&nbsp; To the
first of these advantages I could lay no claim, for my fingers
were all thumbs.&nbsp; Some at least of the others I possessed;
and finding much entertainment in our commerce, I did not suffer
my advantages to rust.&nbsp; I have never despised the social
arts, in which it is a national boast that every Frenchman should
excel.&nbsp; For the approach of particular sorts of visitors, I
had a particular manner of address, and even of appearance, which
I could readily assume and change on the occasion rising.&nbsp; I
never lost an opportunity to flatter either the person of my
visitor, if it should be a lady, or, if it should be a man, the
greatness of his country in war.&nbsp; And in case my compliments
should miss their aim, I was always ready to cover my retreat
with some agreeable pleasantry, which would often earn me the
name of an &lsquo;oddity&rsquo; or a &lsquo;droll
fellow.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this way, although I was so left-handed a
toy-maker, I made out to be rather a successful merchant; and
found means to procure many little delicacies and alleviations,
such as children or prisoners desire.</p>
<p>I am scarcely drawing the portrait of a very melancholy
man.&nbsp; It is not indeed my character; and I had, in a
comparison with my comrades, many reasons for content.&nbsp; In
the first place, I had no family: I was an orphan and a bachelor;
neither wife nor child awaited me in France.&nbsp; In the second,
I had never wholly forgot the emotions with which I first found
myself a prisoner; and although a military prison be not
altogether a garden of delights, it is still preferable to a
gallows.&nbsp; In the third, I am almost ashamed to say it, but I
found a certain pleasure in our place of residence: being an
obsolete and really mediaeval fortress, high placed and
commanding extraordinary prospects, not only over sea, mountain,
and champaign but actually over the thoroughfares of a capital
city, which we could see blackened by day with the moving crowd
of the inhabitants, and at night shining with lamps.&nbsp; And
lastly, although I was not insensible to the restraints of prison
or the scantiness of our rations, I remembered I had sometimes
eaten quite as ill in Spain, and had to mount guard and march
perhaps a dozen leagues into the bargain.&nbsp; The first of my
troubles, indeed, was the costume we were obliged to wear.&nbsp;
There is a horrible practice in England to trick out in
ridiculous uniforms, and as it were to brand in mass, not only
convicts but military prisoners, and even the children in charity
schools.&nbsp; I think some malignant genius had found his
masterpiece of irony in the dress which we were condemned to
wear: jacket, waistcoat, and trousers of a sulphur or mustard
yellow, and a shirt or blue-and-white striped cotton.&nbsp; It
was conspicuous, it was cheap, it pointed us out to
laughter&mdash;we, who were old soldiers, used to arms, and some
of us showing noble scars,&mdash;like a set of lugubrious zanies
at a fair.&nbsp; The old name of that rock on which our prison
stood was (I have heard since then) the <i>Painted
Hill</i>.&nbsp; Well, now it was all painted a bright yellow with
our costumes; and the dress of the soldiers who guarded us being
of course the essential British red rag, we made up together the
elements of a lively picture of hell.&nbsp; I have again and
again looked round upon my fellow-prisoners, and felt my anger
rise, and choked upon tears, to behold them thus parodied.&nbsp;
The more part, as I have said, were peasants, somewhat bettered
perhaps by the drill-sergeant, but for all that ungainly, loutish
fellows, with no more than a mere barrack-room smartness of
address: indeed, you could have seen our army nowhere more
discreditably represented than in this Castle of Edinburgh.&nbsp;
And I used to see myself in fancy, and blush.&nbsp; It seemed
that my more elegant carriage would but point the insult of the
travesty.&nbsp; And I remembered the days when I wore the coarse
but honourable coat of a soldier; and remembered further back how
many of the noble, the fair, and the gracious had taken a delight
to tend my childhood. . . .&nbsp; But I must not recall these
tender and sorrowful memories twice; their place is further on,
and I am now upon another business.&nbsp; The perfidy of the
Britannic Government stood nowhere more openly confessed than in
one particular of our discipline: that we were shaved twice in
the week.&nbsp; To a man who has loved all his life to be fresh
shaven, can a more irritating indignity be devised?&nbsp; Monday
and Thursday were the days.&nbsp; Take the Thursday, and conceive
the picture I must present by Sunday evening!&nbsp; And Saturday,
which was almost as bad, was the great day for visitors.</p>
<p>Those who came to our market were of all qualities, men and
women, the lean and the stout, the plain and the fairly
pretty.&nbsp; Sure, if people at all understood the power of
beauty, there would be no prayers addressed except to Venus; and
the mere privilege of beholding a comely woman is worth paying
for.&nbsp; Our visitors, upon the whole, were not much to boast
of; and yet, sitting in a corner and very much ashamed of myself
and my absurd appearance, I have again and again tasted the
finest, the rarest, and the most ethereal pleasures in a glance
of an eye that I should never see again&mdash;and never wanted
to.&nbsp; The flower of the hedgerow and the star in heaven
satisfy and delight us: how much more the look of that exquisite
being who was created to bear and rear, to madden and rejoice,
mankind!</p>
<p>There was one young lady in particular, about eighteen or
nineteen, tall, of a gallant carriage, and with a profusion of
hair in which the sun found threads of gold.&nbsp; As soon as she
came in the courtyard (and she was a rather frequent visitor) it
seemed I was aware of it.&nbsp; She had an air of angelic
candour, yet of a high spirit; she stepped like a Diana, every
movement was noble and free.&nbsp; One day there was a strong
east wind; the banner was straining at the flagstaff; below us
the smoke of the city chimneys blew hither and thither in a
thousand crazy variations; and away out on the Forth we could see
the ships lying down to it and scudding.&nbsp; I was thinking
what a vile day it was, when she appeared.&nbsp; Her hair blew in
the wind with changes of colour; her garments moulded her with
the accuracy of sculpture; the ends of her shawl fluttered about
her ear and were caught in again with an inimitable
deftness.&nbsp; You have seen a pool on a gusty day, how it
suddenly sparkles and flashes like a thing alive?&nbsp; So this
lady&rsquo;s face had become animated and coloured; and as I saw
her standing, somewhat inclined, her lips parted, a divine
trouble in her eyes, I could have clapped my hands in applause,
and was ready to acclaim her a genuine daughter of the
winds.&nbsp; What put it in my head, I know not: perhaps because
it was a Thursday and I was new from the razor; but I determined
to engage her attention no later than that day.&nbsp; She was
approaching that part of the court in which I sat with my
merchandise, when I observed her handkerchief to escape from her
hands and fall to the ground; the next moment the wind had taken
it up and carried it within my reach.&nbsp; I was on foot at
once: I had forgot my mustard-coloured clothes, I had forgot the
private soldier and his salute.&nbsp; Bowing deeply, I offered
her the slip of cambric.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;your handkerchief.&nbsp;
The wind brought it me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I met her eyes fully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank you, sir,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wind brought it me,&rsquo; I repeated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;May I not take it for an omen?&nbsp; You have an English
proverb, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ill wind that blows nobody
good.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, with a smile, &lsquo;&ldquo;One
good turn deserves another.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will see what you
have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She followed me to where my wares were spread out under lee of
a piece of cannon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas, mademoiselle!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am no very
perfect craftsman.&nbsp; This is supposed to be a house, and you
see the chimneys are awry.&nbsp; You may call this a box if you
are very indulgent; but see where my tool slipped!&nbsp; Yes, I
am afraid you may go from one to another, and find a flaw in
everything.&nbsp; <i>Failures for Sale</i> should be on my
signboard.&nbsp; I do not keep a shop; I keep a Humorous
Museum.&rsquo;&nbsp; I cast a smiling glance about my display,
and then at her, and instantly became grave.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Strange, is it not,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;that a grown
man and a soldier should be engaged upon such trash, and a sad
heart produce anything so funny to look at?&rsquo;</p>
<p>An unpleasant voice summoned her at this moment by the name of
Flora, and she made a hasty purchase and rejoined her party.</p>
<p>A few days after she came again.&nbsp; But I must first tell
you how she came to be so frequent.&nbsp; Her aunt was one of
those terrible British old maids, of which the world has heard
much; and having nothing whatever to do, and a word or two of
French, she had taken what she called an <i>interest in the
French prisoners</i>.&nbsp; A big, bustling, bold old lady, she
flounced about our market-place with insufferable airs of
patronage and condescension.&nbsp; She bought, indeed, with
liberality, but her manner of studying us through a
quizzing-glass, and playing cicerone to her followers, acquitted
us of any gratitude.&nbsp; She had a tail behind her of heavy,
obsequious old gentlemen, or dull, giggling misses, to whom she
appeared to be an oracle.&nbsp; &lsquo;This one can really carve
prettily: is he not a quiz with his big whiskers?&rsquo; she
would say.&nbsp; &lsquo;And this one,&rsquo; indicating myself
with her gold eye-glass, &lsquo;is, I assure you, quite an
oddity.&rsquo;&nbsp; The oddity, you may be certain, ground his
teeth.&nbsp; She had a way of standing in our midst, nodding
around, and addressing us in what she imagined to be French:
&lsquo;<i>Bienne</i>, <i>hommes</i>! <i>&ccedil;a va
bienne</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; I took the freedom to reply in the same
lingo: <i>Bienne</i>, <i>femme</i>! <i>&ccedil;a va couci-couci
tout d&rsquo;m&ecirc;me</i>, <i>la bourgeoise</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And at that, when we had all laughed with a little more
heartiness than was entirely civil, &lsquo;I told you he was
quite an oddity!&rsquo; says she in triumph.&nbsp; Needless to
say, these passages were before I had remarked the niece.</p>
<p>The aunt came on the day in question with a following rather
more than usually large, which she manoeuvred to and fro about
the market and lectured to at rather more than usual length, and
with rather less than her accustomed tact.&nbsp; I kept my eyes
down, but they were ever fixed in the same direction, quite in
vain.&nbsp; The aunt came and went, and pulled us out, and showed
us off, like caged monkeys; but the niece kept herself on the
outskirts of the crowd and on the opposite side of the courtyard,
and departed at last as she had come, without a sign.&nbsp;
Closely as I had watched her, I could not say her eyes had ever
rested on me for an instant; and my heart was overwhelmed with
bitterness and blackness.&nbsp; I tore out her detested image; I
felt I was done with her for ever; I laughed at myself savagely,
because I had thought to please; when I lay down at night sleep
forsook me, and I lay, and rolled, and gloated on her charms, and
cursed her insensibility, for half the night.&nbsp; How trivial I
thought her! and how trivial her sex!&nbsp; A man might be an
angel or an Apollo, and a mustard-coloured coat would wholly
blind them to his merits.&nbsp; I was a prisoner, a slave, a
contemned and despicable being, the butt of her sniggering
countrymen.&nbsp; I would take the lesson: no proud daughter of
my foes should have the chance to mock at me again; none in the
future should have the chance to think I had looked at her with
admiration.&nbsp; You cannot imagine any one of a more resolute
and independent spirit, or whose bosom was more wholly mailed
with patriotic arrogance, than I.&nbsp; Before I dropped asleep,
I had remembered all the infamies of Britain, and debited them in
an overwhelming column to Flora.</p>
<p>The next day, as I sat in my place, I became conscious there
was some one standing near; and behold, it was herself!&nbsp; I
kept my seat, at first in the confusion of my mind, later on from
policy; and she stood, and leaned a little over me, as in
pity.&nbsp; She was very still and timid; her voice was
low.&nbsp; Did I suffer in my captivity? she asked me.&nbsp; Had
I to complain of any hardship?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mademoiselle, I have not learned to complain,&rsquo;
said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a soldier of Napoleon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;At least you must regret <i>La
France</i>,&rsquo; said she, and coloured a little as she
pronounced the words, which she did with a pretty strangeness of
accent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What am I to say?&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you
were carried from this country, for which you seem so wholly
suited, where the very rains and winds seem to become you like
ornaments, would you regret, do you think?&nbsp; We must surely
all regret! the son to his mother, the man to his country; these
are native feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have a mother?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In heaven, mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She, and my father also, went by the same road to heaven
as so many others of the fair and brave: they followed their
queen upon the scaffold.&nbsp; So, you see, I am not so much to
be pitied in my prison,&rsquo; I continued: &lsquo;there are none
to wait for me; I am alone in the world.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
different case, for instance, with yon poor fellow in the cloth
cap.&nbsp; His bed is next to mine, and in the night I hear him
sobbing to himself.&nbsp; He has a tender character, full of
tender and pretty sentiments; and in the dark at night, and
sometimes by day when he can get me apart with him, he laments a
mother and a sweetheart.&nbsp; Do you know what made him take me
for a confidant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She parted her lips with a look, but did not speak.&nbsp; The
look burned all through me with a sudden vital heat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I had once seen, in marching by, the belfry of
his village!&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;The circumstance is
quaint enough.&nbsp; It seems to bind up into one the whole
bundle of those human instincts that make life beautiful, and
people and places dear&mdash;and from which it would seem I am
cut off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I rested my chin on my knee and looked before me on the
ground.&nbsp; I had been talking until then to hold her; but I
was now not sorry she should go: an impression is a thing so
delicate to produce and so easy to overthrow!&nbsp; Presently she
seemed to make an effort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will take this toy,&rsquo; she said, laid a
five-and-sixpenny piece in my hand, and was gone ere I could
thank her.</p>
<p>I retired to a place apart near the ramparts and behind a
gun.&nbsp; The beauty, the expression of her eyes, the tear that
had trembled there, the compassion in her voice, and a kind of
wild elegance that consecrated the freedom of her movements, all
combined to enslave my imagination and inflame my heart.&nbsp;
What had she said?&nbsp; Nothing to signify; but her eyes had met
mine, and the fire they had kindled burned inextinguishably in my
veins.&nbsp; I loved her; and I did not fear to hope.&nbsp; Twice
I had spoken with her; and in both interviews I had been well
inspired, I had engaged her sympathies, I had found words that
she must remember, that would ring in her ears at night upon her
bed.&nbsp; What mattered if I were half shaved and my clothes a
caricature?&nbsp; I was still a man, and I had drawn my image on
her memory.&nbsp; I was still a man, and, as I trembled to
realise, she was still a woman.&nbsp; Many waters cannot quench
love; and love, which is the law of the world, was on my
side.&nbsp; I closed my eyes, and she sprang up on the background
of the darkness, more beautiful than in life.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;and you too, my dear, you too
must carry away with you a picture, that you are still to behold
again and still to embellish.&nbsp; In the darkness of night, in
the streets by day, still you are to have my voice and face,
whispering, making love for me, encroaching on your shy
heart.&nbsp; Shy as your heart is, <i>it</i> is lodged
there&mdash;<i>I</i> am lodged there; let the hours do their
office&mdash;let time continue to draw me ever in more lively,
ever in more insidious colours.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then I had a
vision of myself, and burst out laughing.</p>
<p>A likely thing, indeed, that a beggar-man, a private soldier,
a prisoner in a yellow travesty, was to awake the interest of
this fair girl!&nbsp; I would not despair; but I saw the game
must be played fine and close.&nbsp; It must be my policy to hold
myself before her, always in a pathetic or pleasing attitude;
never to alarm or startle her; to keep my own secret locked in my
bosom like a story of disgrace, and let hers (if she could be
induced to have one) grow at its own rate; to move just so fast,
and not by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth any faster, than the
inclination of her heart.&nbsp; I was the man, and yet I was
passive, tied by the foot in prison.&nbsp; I could not go to her;
I must cast a spell upon her at each visit, so that she should
return to me; and this was a matter of nice management.&nbsp; I
had done it the last time&mdash;it seemed impossible she should
not come again after our interview; and for the next I had
speedily ripened a fresh plan.&nbsp; A prisoner, if he has one
great disability for a lover, has yet one considerable advantage:
there is nothing to distract him, and he can spend all his hours
ripening his love and preparing its manifestations.&nbsp; I had
been then some days upon a piece of carving,&mdash;no less than
the emblem of Scotland, the Lion Rampant.&nbsp; This I proceeded
to finish with what skill I was possessed of; and when at last I
could do no more to it (and, you may be sure, was already
regretting I had done so much), added on the base the following
dedication.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&Agrave; LA BELLE
FLORA<br />
<span class="smcap">le prisonnier reconnaissant</span><br />
<span class="smcap">A. d. St.&nbsp; Y. d. K.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I put my heart into the carving of these letters.&nbsp; What
was done with so much ardour, it seemed scarce possible that any
should behold with indifference; and the initials would at least
suggest to her my noble birth.&nbsp; I thought it better to
suggest: I felt that mystery was my stock-in-trade; the contrast
between my rank and manners, between my speech and my clothing,
and the fact that she could only think of me by a combination of
letters, must all tend to increase her interest and engage her
heart.</p>
<p>This done, there was nothing left for me but to wait and to
hope.&nbsp; And there is nothing further from my character: in
love and in war, I am all for the forward movement; and these
days of waiting made my purgatory.&nbsp; It is a fact that I
loved her a great deal better at the end of them, for love comes,
like bread, from a perpetual rehandling.&nbsp; And besides, I was
fallen into a panic of fear.&nbsp; How, if she came no more, how
was I to continue to endure my empty days? how was I to fall back
and find my interest in the major&rsquo;s lessons, the
lieutenant&rsquo;s chess, in a twopenny sale in the market, or a
halfpenny addition to the prison fare?</p>
<p>Days went by, and weeks; I had not the courage to calculate,
and to-day I have not the courage to remember; but at last she
was there.&nbsp; At last I saw her approach me in the company of
a boy about her own age, and whom I divined at once to be her
brother.</p>
<p>I rose and bowed in silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is my brother, Mr. Ronald Gilchrist,&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have told him of your sufferings.&nbsp; He is
so sorry for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is more than I have the right to ask,&rsquo; I
replied; &lsquo;but among gentlefolk these generous sentiments
are natural.&nbsp; If your brother and I were to meet in the
field, we should meet like tigers; but when he sees me here
disarmed and helpless, he forgets his animosity.&rsquo;&nbsp; (At
which, as I had ventured to expect, this beardless champion
coloured to the ears for pleasure.)&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, my dear
young lady,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;there are many of your
countrymen languishing in my country, even as I do here.&nbsp; I
can but hope there is found some French lady to convey to each of
them the priceless consolation of her sympathy.&nbsp; You have
given me alms; and more than alms&mdash;hope; and while you were
absent I was not forgetful.&nbsp; Suffer me to be able to tell
myself that I have at least tried to make a return; and for the
prisoner&rsquo;s sake deign to accept this trifle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying, I offered her my lion, which she took, looked at in
some embarrassment, and then, catching sight of the dedication,
broke out with a cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, how did you know my name?&rsquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When names are so appropriate, they should be easily
guessed,&rsquo; said I, bowing.&nbsp; &lsquo;But indeed, there
was no magic in the matter.&nbsp; A lady called you by name on
the day I found your handkerchief, and I was quick to remark and
cherish it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very, very beautiful,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and
I shall be always proud of the inscription.&mdash;Come, Ronald,
we must be going.&rsquo;&nbsp; She bowed to me as a lady bows to
her equal, and passed on (I could have sworn) with a heightened
colour.</p>
<p>I was overjoyed: my innocent ruse had succeeded; she had taken
my gift without a hint of payment, and she would scarce sleep in
peace till she had made it up to me.&nbsp; No greenhorn in
matters of the heart, I was besides aware that I had now a
resident ambassador at the court of my lady.&nbsp; The lion might
be ill chiselled; it was mine.&nbsp; My hands had made and held
it; my knife&mdash;or, to speak more by the mark, my rusty
nail&mdash;had traced those letters; and simple as the words
were, they would keep repeating to her that I was grateful and
that I found her fair.&nbsp; The boy had looked like a gawky, and
blushed at a compliment; I could see besides that he regarded me
with considerable suspicion; yet he made so manly a figure of a
lad, that I could not withhold from him my sympathy.&nbsp; And as
for the impulse that had made her bring and introduce him, I
could not sufficiently admire it.&nbsp; It seemed to me finer
than wit, and more tender than a caress.&nbsp; It said (plain as
language), &lsquo;I do not and I cannot know you.&nbsp; Here is
my brother&mdash;you can know him; this is the way to
me&mdash;follow it.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;A TALE OF A PAIR OF SCISSORS</h2>
<p>I was still plunged in these thoughts when the bell was rung
that discharged our visitors into the street.&nbsp; Our little
market was no sooner closed than we were summoned to the
distribution, and received our rations, which we were then
allowed to eat according to fancy in any part of our
quarters.</p>
<p>I have said the conduct of some of our visitors was unbearably
offensive; it was possibly more so than they dreamed&mdash;as the
sight-seers at a menagerie may offend in a thousand ways, and
quite without meaning it, the noble and unfortunate animals
behind the bars; and there is no doubt but some of my compatriots
were susceptible beyond reason.&nbsp; Some of these old
whiskerandos, originally peasants, trained since boyhood in
victorious armies, and accustomed to move among subject and
trembling populations, could ill brook their change of
circumstance.&nbsp; There was one man of the name of Goguelat, a
brute of the first water, who had enjoyed no touch of
civilisation beyond the military discipline, and had risen by an
extreme heroism of bravery to a grade for which he was otherwise
unfitted&mdash;that of <i>mar&eacute;chal des logis</i> in the
22nd of the line.&nbsp; In so far as a brute can be a good
soldier, he was a good soldier; the Cross was on his breast, and
gallantly earned; but in all things outside his line of duty the
man was no other than a brawling, bruising ignorant pillar of low
pothouses.&nbsp; As a gentleman by birth, and a scholar by taste
and education, I was the type of all that he least understood and
most detested; and the mere view of our visitors would leave him
daily in a transport of annoyance, which he would make haste to
wreak on the nearest victim, and too often on myself.</p>
<p>It was so now.&nbsp; Our rations were scarce served out, and I
had just withdrawn into a corner of the yard, when I perceived
him drawing near.&nbsp; He wore an air of hateful mirth; a set of
young fools, among whom he passed for a wit, followed him with
looks of expectation; and I saw I was about to be the object of
some of his insufferable pleasantries.&nbsp; He took a place
beside me, spread out his rations, drank to me derisively from
his measure of prison beer, and began.&nbsp; What he said it
would be impossible to print; but his admirers, who believed
their wit to have surpassed himself, actually rolled among the
gravel.&nbsp; For my part, I thought at first I should have
died.&nbsp; I had not dreamed the wretch was so observant; but
hate sharpens the ears, and he had counted our interviews and
actually knew Flora by her name.&nbsp; Gradually my coolness
returned to me, accompanied by a volume of living anger that
surprised myself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you nearly done?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Because if you are, I am about to say a word or two
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, fair play!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Turn
about!&nbsp; The Marquis of Carabas to the tribune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have to inform
you that I am a gentleman.&nbsp; You do not know what that means,
hey?&nbsp; Well, I will tell you.&nbsp; It is a comical sort of
animal; springs from another strange set of creatures they call
ancestors; and, in common with toads and other vermin, has a
thing that he calls feelings.&nbsp; The lion is a gentleman; he
will not touch carrion.&nbsp; I am a gentleman, and I cannot bear
to soil my fingers with such a lump of dirt.&nbsp; Sit still,
Philippe Goguelat! sit still and do not say a word, or I shall
know you are a coward; the eyes of our guards are upon us.&nbsp;
Here is your health!&rsquo; said I, and pledged him in the prison
beer.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have chosen to speak in a certain way of a
young child,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;who might be your
daughter, and who was giving alms to me and some others of us
mendicants.&nbsp; If the
Emperor&rsquo;&mdash;saluting&mdash;&lsquo;if my Emperor could
hear you, he would pluck off the Cross from your gross
body.&nbsp; I cannot do that; I cannot take away what His Majesty
has given; but one thing I promise you&mdash;I promise you,
Goguelat, you shall be dead to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had borne so much from him in the past, I believe he thought
there was no end to my forbearance, and he was at first
amazed.&nbsp; But I have the pleasure to think that some of my
expressions had pierced through his thick hide; and besides, the
brute was truly a hero of valour, and loved fighting for
itself.&nbsp; Whatever the cause, at least, he had soon pulled
himself together, and took the thing (to do him justice)
handsomely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I promise you, by the devil&rsquo;s horns, that you
shall have the chance!&rsquo; said he, and pledged me again; and
again I did him scrupulous honour.</p>
<p>The news of this defiance spread from prisoner to prisoner
with the speed of wings; every face was seen to be illuminated
like those of the spectators at a horse-race; and indeed you must
first have tasted the active life of a soldier, and then
mouldered for a while in the tedium of a jail, in order to
understand, perhaps even to excuse, the delight of our
companions.&nbsp; Goguelat and I slept in the same squad, which
greatly simplified the business; and a committee of honour was
accordingly formed of our shed-mates.&nbsp; They chose for
president a sergeant-major in the 4th Dragoons, a greybeard of
the army, an excellent military subject, and a good man.&nbsp; He
took the most serious view of his functions, visited us both, and
reported our replies to the committee.&nbsp; Mine was of a decent
firmness.&nbsp; I told him the young lady of whom Goguelat had
spoken had on several occasions given me alms.&nbsp; I reminded
him that, if we were now reduced to hold out our hands and sell
pill-boxes for charity, it was something very new for soldiers of
the Empire.&nbsp; We had all seen bandits standing at a corner of
a wood truckling for copper halfpence, and after their
benefactors were gone spitting out injuries and curses.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I trust that none of us will
fall so low.&nbsp; As a Frenchman and a soldier, I owe that young
child gratitude, and am bound to protect her character, and to
support that of the army.&nbsp; You are my elder and my superior:
tell me if I am not right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was a quiet-mannered old fellow, and patted me with three
fingers on the back.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est bien</i>, <i>mon
enfant</i>,&rsquo; says he, and returned to his committee.</p>
<p>Goguelat was no more accommodating than myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
do not like apologies nor those that make them,&rsquo; was his
only answer.&nbsp; And there remained nothing but to arrange the
details of the meeting.&nbsp; So far as regards place and time we
had no choice; we must settle the dispute at night, in the dark,
after a round had passed by, and in the open middle of the shed
under which we slept.&nbsp; The question of arms was more
obscure.&nbsp; We had a good many tools, indeed, which we
employed in the manufacture of our toys; but they were none of
them suited for a single combat between civilised men, and, being
nondescript, it was found extremely hard to equalise the chances
of the combatants.&nbsp; At length a pair of scissors was
unscrewed; and a couple of tough wands being found in a corner of
the courtyard, one blade of the scissors was lashed solidly to
each with resined twine&mdash;the twine coming I know not whence,
but the resin from the green pillars of the shed, which still
sweated from the axe.&nbsp; It was a strange thing to feel in
one&rsquo;s hand this weapon, which was no heavier than a
riding-rod, and which it was difficult to suppose would prove
more dangerous.&nbsp; A general oath was administered and taken,
that no one should interfere in the duel nor (suppose it to
result seriously) betray the name of the survivor.&nbsp; And with
that, all being then ready, we composed ourselves to await the
moment.</p>
<p>The evening fell cloudy; not a star was to be seen when the
first round of the night passed through our shed and wound off
along the ramparts; and as we took our places, we could still
hear, over the murmurs of the surrounding city, the sentries
challenging its further passage.&nbsp; Leclos, the
sergeant-major, set us in our stations, engaged our wands, and
left us.&nbsp; To avoid blood-stained clothing, my adversary and
I had stripped to the shoes; and the chill of the night enveloped
our bodies like a wet sheet.&nbsp; The man was better at fencing
than myself; he was vastly taller than I, being of a stature
almost gigantic, and proportionately strong.&nbsp; In the inky
blackness of the shed, it was impossible to see his eyes; and
from the suppleness of the wands, I did not like to trust to a
parade.&nbsp; I made up my mind accordingly to profit, if I
might, by my defect; and as soon as the signal should be given,
to throw myself down and lunge at the same moment.&nbsp; It was
to play my life upon one card: should I not mortally wound him,
no defence would be left me; what was yet more appalling, I thus
ran the risk of bringing my own face against his scissor with the
double force of our assaults, and my face and eyes are not that
part of me that I would the most readily expose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Allez</i>!&rsquo; said the sergeant-major.</p>
<p>Both lunged in the same moment with an equal fury, and but for
my manoeuvre both had certainly been spitted.&nbsp; As it was, he
did no more than strike my shoulder, while my scissor plunged
below the girdle into a mortal part; and that great bulk of a
man, falling from his whole height, knocked me immediately
senseless.</p>
<p>When I came to myself I was laid in my own sleeping-place, and
could make out in the darkness the outline of perhaps a dozen
heads crowded around me.&nbsp; I sat up.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is
it?&rsquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said the sergeant-major.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Blessed be God, all is well.&rsquo;&nbsp; I felt him clasp
my hand, and there were tears in his voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis but a scratch, my child; here is papa, who is
taking good care of you.&nbsp; Your shoulder is bound up; we have
dressed you in your clothes again, and it will all be
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this I began to remember.&nbsp; &lsquo;And Goguelat?&rsquo;
I gasped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He cannot bear to be moved; he has his bellyful;
&rsquo;tis a bad business,&rsquo; said the sergeant-major.</p>
<p>The idea of having killed a man with such an instrument as
half a pair of scissors seemed to turn my stomach.&nbsp; I am
sure I might have killed a dozen with a firelock, a sabre, a
bayonet, or any accepted weapon, and been visited by no such
sickness of remorse.&nbsp; And to this feeling every unusual
circumstance of our rencounter, the darkness in which we had
fought, our nakedness, even the resin on the twine, appeared to
contribute.&nbsp; I ran to my fallen adversary, kneeled by him,
and could only sob his name.</p>
<p>He bade me compose myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have given me the
key of the fields, comrade,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Sans
rancune</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this my horror redoubled.&nbsp; Here had we two expatriated
Frenchmen engaged in an ill-regulated combat like the battles of
beasts.&nbsp; Here was he, who had been all his life so great a
ruffian, dying in a foreign land of this ignoble injury, and
meeting death with something of the spirit of a Bayard.&nbsp; I
insisted that the guards should be summoned and a doctor
brought.&nbsp; &lsquo;It may still be possible to save
him,&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>The sergeant-major reminded me of our engagement.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you had been wounded,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you must
have lain there till the patrol came by and found you.&nbsp; It
happens to be Goguelat&mdash;and so must he!&nbsp; Come, child,
time to go to by-by.&rsquo;&nbsp; And as I still resisted,
&lsquo;Champdivers!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this is
weakness.&nbsp; You pain me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, off to your beds with you!&rsquo; said Goguelat,
and named us in a company with one of his jovial gross
epithets.</p>
<p>Accordingly the squad lay down in the dark and simulated, what
they certainly were far from experiencing, sleep.&nbsp; It was
not yet late.&nbsp; The city, from far below, and all around us,
sent up a sound of wheels and feet and lively voices.&nbsp; Yet
awhile, and the curtain of the cloud was rent across, and in the
space of sky between the eaves of the shed and the irregular
outline of the ramparts a multitude of stars appeared.&nbsp;
Meantime, in the midst of us lay Goguelat, and could not always
withhold himself from groaning.</p>
<p>We heard the round far off; heard it draw slowly nearer.&nbsp;
Last of all, it turned the corner and moved into our field of
vision: two file of men and a corporal with a lantern, which he
swung to and fro, so as to cast its light in the recesses of the
yards and sheds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; cried the corporal, pausing as he came by
Goguelat.</p>
<p>He stooped with his lantern.&nbsp; All our hearts were
flying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What devil&rsquo;s work is this?&rsquo; he cried, and
with a startling voice summoned the guard.</p>
<p>We were all afoot upon the instant; more lanterns and soldiers
crowded in front of the shed; an officer elbowed his way
in.&nbsp; In the midst was the big naked body, soiled with
blood.&nbsp; Some one had covered him with his blanket; but as he
lay there in agony, he had partly thrown it off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is murder!&rsquo; cried the officer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You wild beasts, you will hear of this
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Goguelat was raised and laid upon a stretcher, he cried to
us a cheerful and blasphemous farewell.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III&mdash;MAJOR CHEVENIX COMES INTO THE STORY, AND
GOGUELAT GOES OUT</h2>
<p>There was never any talk of a recovery, and no time was lost
in getting the man&rsquo;s deposition.&nbsp; He gave but the one
account of it: that he had committed suicide because he was sick
of seeing so many Englishmen.&nbsp; The doctor vowed it was
impossible, the nature and direction of the wound forbidding
it.&nbsp; Goguelat replied that he was more ingenious than the
other thought for, and had propped up the weapon in the ground
and fallen on the point&mdash;&lsquo;just like
Nebuchadnezzar,&rsquo; he added, winking to the assistants.&nbsp;
The doctor, who was a little, spruce, ruddy man of an impatient
temper, pished and pshawed and swore over his patient.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing to be made of him!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
perfect heathen.&nbsp; If we could only find the
weapon!&rsquo;&nbsp; But the weapon had ceased to exist.&nbsp; A
little resined twine was perhaps blowing about in the castle
gutters; some bits of broken stick may have trailed in corners;
and behold, in the pleasant air of the morning, a dandy prisoner
trimming his nails with a pair of scissors!</p>
<p>Finding the wounded man so firm, you may be sure the
authorities did not leave the rest of us in peace.&nbsp; No stone
was left unturned.&nbsp; We were had in again and again to be
examined, now singly, now in twos and threes.&nbsp; We were
threatened with all sorts of impossible severities and tempted
with all manner of improbable rewards.&nbsp; I suppose I was five
times interrogated, and came off from each with flying
colours.&nbsp; I am like old Souvaroff, I cannot understand a
soldier being taken aback by any question; he should answer, as
he marches on the fire, with an instant briskness and
gaiety.&nbsp; I may have been short of bread, gold or grace; I
was never yet found wanting in an answer.&nbsp; My comrades, if
they were not all so ready, were none of them less staunch; and I
may say here at once that the inquiry came to nothing at the
time, and the death of Goguelat remained a mystery of the
prison.&nbsp; Such were the veterans of France!&nbsp; And yet I
should be disingenuous if I did not own this was a case apart; in
ordinary circumstances, some one might have stumbled or been
intimidated into an admission; and what bound us together with a
closeness beyond that of mere comrades was a secret to which we
were all committed and a design in which all were equally
engaged.&nbsp; No need to inquire as to its nature: there is only
one desire, and only one kind of design, that blooms in
prisons.&nbsp; And the fact that our tunnel was near done
supported and inspired us.</p>
<p>I came off in public, as I have said, with flying colours; the
sittings of the court of inquiry died away like a tune that no
one listens to; and yet I was unmasked&mdash;I, whom my very
adversary defended, as good as confessed, as good as told the
nature of the quarrel, and by so doing prepared for myself in the
future a most anxious, disagreeable adventure.&nbsp; It was the
third morning after the duel, and Goguelat was still in life,
when the time came round for me to give Major Chevenix a
lesson.&nbsp; I was fond of this occupation; not that he paid me
much&mdash;no more, indeed, than eighteenpence a month, the
customary figure, being a miser in the grain; but because I liked
his breakfasts and (to some extent) himself.&nbsp; At least, he
was a man of education; and of the others with whom I had any
opportunity of speech, those that would not have held a book
upsidedown would have torn the pages out for pipe-lights.&nbsp;
For I must repeat again that our body of prisoners was
exceptional: there was in Edinburgh Castle none of that
educational busyness that distinguished some of the other
prisons, so that men entered them unable to read, and left them
fit for high employments.&nbsp; Chevenix was handsome, and
surprisingly young to be a major: six feet in his stockings, well
set up, with regular features and very clear grey eyes.&nbsp; It
was impossible to pick a fault in him, and yet the sum-total was
displeasing.&nbsp; Perhaps he was too clean; he seemed to bear
about with him the smell of soap.&nbsp; Cleanliness is good, but
I cannot bear a man&rsquo;s nails to seem japanned.&nbsp; And
certainly he was too self-possessed and cold.&nbsp; There was
none of the fire of youth, none of the swiftness of the soldier,
in this young officer.&nbsp; His kindness was cold, and cruel
cold; his deliberation exasperating.&nbsp; And perhaps it was
from this character, which is very much the opposite of my own,
that even in these days, when he was of service to me, I
approached him with suspicion and reserve.</p>
<p>I looked over his exercise in the usual form, and marked six
faults.</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Six,&rsquo; says he, looking at the
paper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very annoying!&nbsp; I can never get it
right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but you make excellent progress!&rsquo; I
said.&nbsp; I would not discourage him, you understand, but he
was congenitally unable to learn French.&nbsp; Some fire, I
think, is needful, and he had quenched his fire in soapsuds.</p>
<p>He put the exercise down, leaned his chin upon his hand, and
looked at me with clear, severe eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think we must have a little talk,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am entirely at your disposition,&rsquo; I replied;
but I quaked, for I knew what subject to expect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been some time giving me these lessons,&rsquo;
he went on, &lsquo;and I am tempted to think rather well of
you.&nbsp; I believe you are a gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have that honour, sir,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have seen me for the same period.&nbsp; I do not
know how I strike you; but perhaps you will be prepared to
believe that I also am a man of honour,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I require no assurances; the thing is manifest,&rsquo;
and I bowed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
about this Goguelat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You heard me yesterday before the court,&rsquo; I
began.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was awakened only&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes; I &ldquo;heard you yesterday before the
court,&rdquo; no doubt,&rsquo; he interrupted, &lsquo;and I
remember perfectly that you were &ldquo;awakened
only.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could repeat the most of it by rote,
indeed.&nbsp; But do you suppose that I believed you for a
moment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither would you believe me if I were to repeat it
here,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may be wrong&mdash;we shall soon see,&rsquo; says he;
&lsquo;but my impression is that you will not &ldquo;repeat it
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; My impression is that you have come into this
room, and that you will tell me something before you go
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me explain,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
evidence, of course, is nonsense.&nbsp; I put it by, and the
court put it by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My compliments and thanks!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You <i>must</i> know&mdash;that&rsquo;s the short and
the long,&rsquo; he proceeded.&nbsp; &lsquo;All of you in shed B
are bound to know.&nbsp; And I want to ask you where is the
common-sense of keeping up this farce, and maintaining this
cock-and-bull story between friends.&nbsp; Come, come, my good
fellow, own yourself beaten, and laugh at it yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I hear you, go ahead,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You put your heart in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He crossed his legs slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can very well
understand,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;that precautions have had to
be taken.&nbsp; I dare say an oath was administered.&nbsp; I can
comprehend that perfectly.&rsquo;&nbsp; (He was watching me all
the time with his cold, bright eyes.)&nbsp; &lsquo;And I can
comprehend that, about an affair of honour, you would be very
particular to keep it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About an affair of honour?&rsquo; I repeated, like a
man quite puzzled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not an affair of honour, then?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was not?&nbsp; I do not follow,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>He gave no sign of impatience; simply sat awhile silent, and
began again in the same placid and good-natured voice: &lsquo;The
court and I were at one in setting aside your evidence.&nbsp; It
could not deceive a child.&nbsp; But there was a difference
between myself and the other officers, because <i>I knew my
man</i> and they did not.&nbsp; They saw in you a common soldier,
and I knew you for a gentleman.&nbsp; To them your evidence was a
leash of lies, which they yawned to hear you telling.&nbsp; Now,
I was asking myself, how far will a gentleman go?&nbsp; Not
surely so far as to help hush a murder up?&nbsp; So
that&mdash;when I heard you tell how you knew nothing of the
matter, and were only awakened by the corporal, and all the rest
of it&mdash;I translated your statements into something
else.&nbsp; Now, Champdivers,&rsquo; he cried, springing up
lively and coming towards me with animation, &lsquo;I am going to
tell you what that was, and you are going to help me to see
justice done: how, I don&rsquo;t know, for of course you are
under oath&mdash;but somehow.&nbsp; Mark what I&rsquo;m going to
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment he laid a heavy, hard grip upon my shoulder;
and whether he said anything more or came to a full stop at once,
I am sure I could not tell you to this day.&nbsp; For, as the
devil would have it, the shoulder he laid hold of was the one
Goguelat had pinked.&nbsp; The wound was but a scratch; it was
healing with the first intention; but in the clutch of Major
Chevenix it gave me agony.&nbsp; My head swam; the sweat poured
off my face; I must have grown deadly pale.</p>
<p>He removed his hand as suddenly as he had laid it there.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What is wrong with you?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is nothing,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
qualm.&nbsp; It has gone by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you sure?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are as
white as a sheet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, I assure you!&nbsp; Nothing whatever.&nbsp; I am
my own man again,&rsquo; I said, though I could scarce command my
tongue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, shall I go on again?&rsquo; says he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Can you follow me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, by all means!&rsquo; said I, and mopped my
streaming face upon my sleeve, for you may be sure in those days
I had no handkerchief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are sure you can follow me.&nbsp; That was a
very sudden and sharp seizure,&rsquo; he said doubtfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But if you are sure, all right, and here goes.&nbsp; An
affair of honour among you fellows would, naturally, be a little
difficult to carry out, perhaps it would be impossible to have it
wholly regular.&nbsp; And yet a duel might be very irregular in
form, and, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, loyal
enough in effect.&nbsp; Do you take me?&nbsp; Now, as a gentleman
and a soldier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His hand rose again at the words and hovered over me.&nbsp; I
could bear no more, and winced away from him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I cried,&nbsp; &lsquo;not that.&nbsp; Do not
put your hand upon my shoulder.&nbsp; I cannot bear it.&nbsp; It
is rheumatism,&rsquo; I made haste to add.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
shoulder is inflamed and very painful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He returned to his chair and deliberately lighted a cigar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry about your shoulder,&rsquo; he said at
last.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me send for the doctor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in the least,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a
trifle.&nbsp; I am quite used to it.&nbsp; It does not trouble me
in the smallest.&nbsp; At any rate, I don&rsquo;t believe in
doctors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said he, and sat and smoked a good
while in a silence which I would have given anything to
break.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he began presently, &lsquo;I
believe there is nothing left for me to learn.&nbsp; I presume I
may say that I know all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About what?&rsquo; said I boldly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About Goguelat,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I cannot conceive,&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says the major, &lsquo;the man fell in a
duel, and by your hand!&nbsp; I am not an infant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you seem
to me to be a good deal of a theorist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we test it?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
doctor is close by.&nbsp; If there is not an open wound on your
shoulder, I am wrong.&nbsp; If there is&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He
waved his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I advise you to think
twice.&nbsp; There is a deuce of a nasty drawback to the
experiment&mdash;that what might have remained private between us
two becomes public property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, well!&rsquo; said I, with a laugh, &lsquo;anything
rather than a doctor!&nbsp; I cannot bear the breed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His last words had a good deal relieved me, but I was still
far from comfortable.</p>
<p>Major Chevenix smoked awhile, looking now at his cigar ash,
now at me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a soldier myself,&rsquo; he
says presently, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ve been out in my time and hit
my man.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to run any one into a corner for
an affair that was at all necessary or correct.&nbsp; At the same
time, I want to know that much, and I&rsquo;ll take your word of
honour for it.&nbsp; Otherwise, I shall be very sorry, but the
doctor must be called in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I neither admit anything nor deny anything,&rsquo; I
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;But if this form of words will suffice
you, here is what I say: I give you my parole, as a gentleman and
a soldier, there has nothing taken place amongst us prisoners
that was not honourable as the day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;That was all I
wanted.&nbsp; You can go now, Champdivers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as I was going out he added, with a laugh: &lsquo;By the
bye, I ought to apologise: I had no idea I was applying the
torture!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The same afternoon the doctor came into the courtyard with a
piece of paper in his hand.&nbsp; He seemed hot and angry, and
had certainly no mind to be polite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Which of you
fellows knows any English?&nbsp; Oh!&rsquo;&mdash;spying
me&mdash;&lsquo;there you are, what&rsquo;s your name!&nbsp;
<i>You&rsquo;ll</i> do.&nbsp; Tell these fellows that the other
fellow&rsquo;s dying.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s booked; no use talking; I
expect he&rsquo;ll go by evening.&nbsp; And tell them I
don&rsquo;t envy the feelings of the fellow who spiked him.&nbsp;
Tell them that first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I did so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you can tell &rsquo;em,&rsquo; he resumed,
&lsquo;that the fellow, Goggle&mdash;what&rsquo;s his
name?&mdash;wants to see some of them before he gets his marching
orders.&nbsp; If I got it right, he wants to kiss or embrace you,
or some sickening stuff.&nbsp; Got that?&nbsp; Then here&rsquo;s
a list he&rsquo;s had written, and you&rsquo;d better read it out
to them&mdash;I can&rsquo;t make head or tail of your beastly
names&mdash;and they can answer <i>present</i>, and fall in
against that wall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was with a singular movement of incongruous feelings that I
read the first name on the list.&nbsp; I had no wish to look
again on my own handiwork; my flesh recoiled from the idea; and
how could I be sure what reception he designed to give me?&nbsp;
The cure was in my own hand; I could pass that first name
over&mdash;the doctor would not know&mdash;and I might stay
away.&nbsp; But to the subsequent great gladness of my heart, I
did not dwell for an instant on the thought, walked over to the
designated wall, faced about, read out the name
&lsquo;Champdivers,&rsquo; and answered myself with the word
&lsquo;Present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were some half dozen on the list, all told; and as soon
as we were mustered, the doctor led the way to the hospital, and
we followed after, like a fatigue party, in single file.&nbsp; At
the door he paused, told us &lsquo;the fellow&rsquo; would see
each of us alone, and, as soon as I had explained that, sent me
by myself into the ward.&nbsp; It was a small room, whitewashed;
a south window stood open on a vast depth of air and a spacious
and distant prospect; and from deep below, in the Grassmarket the
voices of hawkers came up clear and far away.&nbsp; Hard by, on a
little bed, lay Goguelat.&nbsp; The sunburn had not yet faded
from his face, and the stamp of death was already there.&nbsp;
There was something wild and unmannish in his smile, that took me
by the throat; only death and love know or have ever seen
it.&nbsp; And when he spoke, it seemed to shame his coarse
talk.</p>
<p>He held out his arms as if to embrace me.&nbsp; I drew near
with incredible shrinkings, and surrendered myself to his arms
with overwhelming disgust.&nbsp; But he only drew my ear down to
his lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trust me,&rsquo; he whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Je suis
bon bougre</i>, <i>moi</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take it to hell with
me, and tell the devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why should I go on to reproduce his grossness and
trivialities?&nbsp; All that he thought, at that hour, was even
noble, though he could not clothe it otherwise than in the
language of a brutal farce.&nbsp; Presently he bade me call the
doctor; and when that officer had come in, raised a little up in
his bed, pointed first to himself and then to me, who stood
weeping by his side, and several times repeated the expression,
&lsquo;Frinds&mdash;frinds&mdash;dam frinds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To my great surprise, the doctor appeared very much
affected.&nbsp; He nodded his little bob-wigged head at us, and
said repeatedly, &lsquo;All right, Johnny&mdash;me
comprong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Goguelat shook hands with me, embraced me again, and I
went out of the room sobbing like an infant.</p>
<p>How often have I not seen it, that the most unpardonable
fellows make the happiest exits!&nbsp; It is a fate we may well
envy them.&nbsp; Goguelat was detested in life; in the last three
days, by his admirable staunchness and consideration, he won
every heart; and when word went about the prison the same evening
that he was no more, the voice of conversation became hushed as
in a house of mourning.</p>
<p>For myself I was like a man distracted; I cannot think what
ailed me: when I awoke the following day, nothing remained of it;
but that night I was filled with a gloomy fury of the
nerves.&nbsp; I had killed him; he had done his utmost to protect
me; I had seen him with that awful smile.&nbsp; And so illogical
and useless is this sentiment of remorse, that I was ready, at a
word or a look, to quarrel with somebody else.&nbsp; I presume
the disposition of my mind was imprinted on my face; and when, a
little after, I overtook, saluted and addressed the doctor, he
looked on me with commiseration and surprise.</p>
<p>I had asked him if it was true.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the fellow&rsquo;s
gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he suffer much?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Devil a bit; passed away like a lamb,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; He looked on me a little, and I saw his hand go to his
fob.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here, take that! no sense in fretting,&rsquo;
he said, and, putting a silver two-penny-bit in my hand, he left
me.</p>
<p>I should have had that twopenny framed to hang upon the wall,
for it was the man&rsquo;s one act of charity in all my knowledge
of him.&nbsp; Instead of that, I stood looking at it in my hand
and laughed out bitterly, as I realised his mistake; then went to
the ramparts, and flung it far into the air like blood
money.&nbsp; The night was falling; through an embrasure and
across the gardened valley I saw the lamplighters hasting along
Princes Street with ladder and lamp, and looked on moodily.&nbsp;
As I was so standing a hand was laid upon my shoulder, and I
turned about.&nbsp; It was Major Chevenix, dressed for the
evening, and his neckcloth really admirably folded.&nbsp; I never
denied the man could dress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I thought it was you,
Champdivers.&nbsp; So he&rsquo;s gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you must cheer
up.&nbsp; Of course it&rsquo;s very distressing, very painful and
all that.&nbsp; But do you know, it ain&rsquo;t such a bad thing
either for you or me?&nbsp; What with his death and your visit to
him I am entirely reassured.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So I was to owe my life to Goguelat at every point.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had rather not discuss it,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;one word more, and
I&rsquo;ll agree to bury the subject.&nbsp; What did you fight
about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, what do men ever fight about?&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A lady?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Deuce you did!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should
scarce have thought it of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And at this my ill-humour broke fairly out in words.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;He never dared to address
her&mdash;only to look at her and vomit his vile insults!&nbsp;
She may have given him sixpence: if she did, it may take him to
heaven yet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this I became aware of his eyes set upon me with a
considering look, and brought up sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good night to
you, Champdivers.&nbsp; Come to me at breakfast-time to-morrow,
and we&rsquo;ll talk of other subjects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I fully admit the man&rsquo;s conduct was not bad: in writing
it down so long after the events I can even see that it was
good.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV&mdash;ST. IVES GETS A BUNDLE OF BANK NOTES</h2>
<p>I was surprised one morning, shortly after, to find myself the
object of marked consideration by a civilian and a
stranger.&nbsp; This was a man of the middle age; he had a face
of a mulberry colour, round black eyes, comical tufted eyebrows,
and a protuberant forehead; and was dressed in clothes of a
Quakerish cut.&nbsp; In spite of his plainness, he had that
inscrutable air of a man well-to-do in his affairs.&nbsp; I
conceived he had been some while observing me from a distance,
for a sparrow sat betwixt us quite unalarmed on the breech of a
piece of cannon.&nbsp; So soon as our eyes met, he drew near and
addressed me in the French language, which he spoke with a good
fluency but an abominable accent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have the pleasure of addressing Monsieur le Vicomte
Anne de K&eacute;roual de Saint-Yves?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I do not call myself all
that; but I have a right to, if I chose.&nbsp; In the meanwhile I
call myself plain Champdivers, at your disposal.&nbsp; It was my
mother&rsquo;s name, and good to go soldiering with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think not quite,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;for if I
remember rightly, your mother also had the particle.&nbsp; Her
name was Florimonde de Champdivers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right again!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and I am extremely
pleased to meet a gentleman so well informed in my
quarterings.&nbsp; Is monsieur Born himself?&rsquo;&nbsp; This I
said with a great air of assumption, partly to conceal the degree
of curiosity with which my visitor had inspired me, and in part
because it struck me as highly incongruous and comical in my
prison garb and on the lips of a private soldier.</p>
<p>He seemed to think so too, for he laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; he returned, speaking this time in
English; &lsquo;I am not &ldquo;<i>born</i>,&rdquo; as you call
it, and must content myself with <i>dying</i>, of which I am
equally susceptible with the best of you.&nbsp; My name is Mr.
Romaine&mdash;Daniel Romaine&mdash;a solicitor of London City, at
your service; and, what will perhaps interest you more, I am here
at the request of your great-uncle, the Count.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;does M. de K&eacute;roual
de St.-Yves remember the existence of such a person as myself,
and will he deign to count kinship with a soldier of
Napoleon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You speak English well,&rsquo; observed my visitor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been a second language to me from a
child,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had an English nurse; my
father spoke English with me; and I was finished by a countryman
of yours and a dear friend of mine, a Mr. Vicary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A strong expression of interest came into the lawyer&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;you knew poor
Vicary?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For more than a year,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and shared
his hiding-place for many months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I was his clerk, and have succeeded him in
business,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Excellent man!&nbsp; It
was on the affairs of M. de K&eacute;roual that he went to that
accursed country, from which he was never destined to
return.&nbsp; Do you chance to know his end, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I do.&nbsp; He
perished miserably at the hands of a gang of banditti, such as we
call <i>chauffeurs</i>.&nbsp; In a word, he was tortured, and
died of it.&nbsp; See,&rsquo; I added, kicking off one shoe, for
I had no stockings; &lsquo;I was no more than a child, and see
how they had begun to treat myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the mark of my old burn with a certain
shrinking.&nbsp; &lsquo;Beastly people!&rsquo; I heard him mutter
to himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The English may say so with a good grace,&rsquo; I
observed politely.</p>
<p>Such speeches were the coin in which I paid my way among this
credulous race.&nbsp; Ninety per cent. of our visitors would have
accepted the remark as natural in itself and creditable to my
powers of judgment, but it appeared my lawyer was more acute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not entirely a fool, I perceive,&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;not wholly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet it is well to beware of the ironical
mood,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a dangerous
instrument.&nbsp; Your great-uncle has, I believe, practised it
very much, until it is now become a problem what he
means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that brings me back to what you will admit is a
most natural inquiry,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;To what do I
owe the pleasure of this visit? how did you recognise me? and how
did you know I was here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Carefull separating his coat skirts, the lawyer took a seat
beside me on the edge of the flags.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is rather an odd story,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;and,
with your leave, I&rsquo;ll answer the second question
first.&nbsp; It was from a certain resemblance you bear to your
cousin, M. le Vicomte.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust, sir, that I resemble him
advantageously?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hasten to reassure you,&rsquo; was the reply:
&lsquo;you do.&nbsp; To my eyes, M. Alain de St.-Yves has scarce
a pleasing exterior.&nbsp; And yet, when I knew you were here,
and was actually looking for you&mdash;why, the likeness
helped.&nbsp; As for how I came to know your whereabouts, by an
odd enough chance, it is again M. Alain we have to thank.&nbsp; I
should tell you, he has for some time made it his business to
keep M. de K&eacute;roual informed of your career; with what
purpose I leave you to judge.&nbsp; When he first brought the
news of your&mdash;that you were serving Buonaparte, it seemed it
might be the death of the old gentleman, so hot was his
resentment.&nbsp; But from one thing to another, matters have a
little changed.&nbsp; Or I should rather say, not a little.&nbsp;
We learned you were under orders for the Peninsula, to fight the
English; then that you had been commissioned for a piece of
bravery, and were again reduced to the ranks.&nbsp; And from one
thing to another (as I say), M. de K&eacute;roual became used to
the idea that you were his kinsman and yet served with
Buonaparte, and filled instead with wonder that he should have
another kinsman who was so remarkably well informed of events in
France.&nbsp; And it now became a very disagreeable question,
whether the young gentleman was not a spy?&nbsp; In short, sir,
in seeking to disserve you, he had accumulated against himself a
load of suspicions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My visitor now paused, took snuff, and looked at me with an
air of benevolence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God, sir!&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;this is a curious
story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will say so before I have done,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;For there have two events followed.&nbsp; The
first of these was an encounter of M. de K&eacute;roual and M. de
Mauseant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know the man to my cost,&rsquo; said I: &lsquo;it was
through him I lost my commission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you tell me so?&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
here is news!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I cannot complain!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
was in the wrong.&nbsp; I did it with my eyes open.&nbsp; If a
man gets a prisoner to guard and lets him go, the least he can
expect is to be degraded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will be paid for it,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You did well for yourself and better for your
king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I had thought I was injuring my emperor,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;I would have let M. de Mauseant burn in hell ere I had
helped him, and be sure of that!&nbsp; I saw in him only a
private person in a difficulty: I let him go in private charity;
not even to profit myself will I suffer it to be
misunderstood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said the lawyer, &lsquo;no matter
now.&nbsp; This is a foolish warmth&mdash;a very misplaced
enthusiasm, believe me!&nbsp; The point of the story is that M.
de Mauseant spoke of you with gratitude, and drew your character
in such a manner as greatly to affect your uncle&rsquo;s
views.&nbsp; Hard upon the back of which, in came your humble
servant, and laid before him the direct proof of what we had been
so long suspecting.&nbsp; There was no dubiety permitted.&nbsp;
M. Alain&rsquo;s expensive way of life, his clothes and
mistresses, his dicing and racehorses, were all explained: he was
in the pay of Buonaparte, a hired spy, and a man that held the
strings of what I can only call a convolution of extremely fishy
enterprises.&nbsp; To do M. de K&eacute;roual justice, he took it
in the best way imaginable, destroyed the evidences of the one
great-nephew&rsquo;s disgrace&mdash;and transferred his interest
wholly to the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What am I to understand by that?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is
a remarkable inconsistency in human nature which gentlemen of my
cloth have a great deal of occasion to observe.&nbsp; Selfish
persons can live without chick or child, they can live without
all mankind except perhaps the barber and the apothecary; but
when it comes to dying, they seem physically unable to die
without an heir.&nbsp; You can apply this principle for
yourself.&nbsp; Viscount Alain, though he scarce guesses it, is
no longer in the field.&nbsp; Remains, Viscount Anne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you give a very
unfavourable impression of my uncle, the Count.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had not meant it,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has
led a loose life&mdash;sadly loose&mdash;but he is a man it is
impossible to know and not to admire; his courtesy is
exquisite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so you think there is actually a chance for
me?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Understand,&rsquo; said he: &lsquo;in saying as much as
I have done, I travel quite beyond my brief.&nbsp; I have been
clothed with no capacity to talk of wills, or heritages, or your
cousin.&nbsp; I was sent here to make but the one communication:
that M. de K&eacute;roual desires to meet his
great-nephew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, looking about me on the
battlements by which we sat surrounded, &lsquo;this is a case in
which Mahomet must certainly come to the mountain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; said Mr. Romaine; &lsquo;you know
already your uncle is an aged man; but I have not yet told you
that he is quite broken up, and his death shortly looked
for.&nbsp; No, no, there is no doubt about it&mdash;it is the
mountain that must come to Mahomet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From an Englishman, the remark is certainly
significant,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but you are of course, and by
trade, a keeper of men&rsquo;s secrets, and I see you keep that
of Cousin Alain, which is not the mark of a truculent patriotism,
to say the least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am first of all the lawyer of your family!&rsquo;
says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That being so,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I can perhaps
stretch a point myself.&nbsp; This rock is very high, and it is
very steep; a man might come by a devil of a fall from almost any
part of it, and yet I believe I have a pair of wings that might
carry me just so far as to the bottom.&nbsp; Once at the bottom I
am helpless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And perhaps it is just then that I could step
in,&rsquo; returned the lawyer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose by some
contingency, at which I make no guess, and on which I offer no
opinion&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But here I interrupted him.&nbsp; &lsquo;One word ere you go
further.&nbsp; I am under no parole,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understood so much,&rsquo; he replied,
&lsquo;although some of you French gentry find their word sit
lightly on them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, I am not one of those,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To do you plain justice, I do not think you one,&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose yourself, then, set free and at the
bottom of the rock,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;although I may
not be able to do much, I believe I can do something to help you
on your road.&nbsp; In the first place I would carry this,
whether in an inside pocket or my shoe.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he
passed me a bundle of bank notes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No harm in that,&rsquo; said I, at once concealing
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the second place,&rsquo; he resumed, &lsquo;it is a
great way from here to where your uncle lives&mdash;Amersham
Place, not far from Dunstable; you have a great part of Britain
to get through; and for the first stages, I must leave you to
your own luck and ingenuity.&nbsp; I have no acquaintance here in
Scotland, or at least&rsquo; (with a grimace) &lsquo;no dishonest
ones.&nbsp; But further to the south, about Wakefield, I am told
there is a gentleman called Burchell Fenn, who is not so
particular as some others, and might be willing to give you a
cast forward.&nbsp; In fact, sir, I believe it&rsquo;s the
man&rsquo;s trade: a piece of knowledge that burns my
mouth.&nbsp; But that is what you get by meddling with rogues;
and perhaps the biggest rogue now extant, M. de Saint-Yves, is
your cousin, M. Alain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If this be a man of my cousin&rsquo;s,&rsquo; I
observed, &lsquo;I am perhaps better to keep clear of
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was through some paper of your cousin&rsquo;s that
we came across his trail,&rsquo; replied the lawyer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I am inclined to think, so far as anything is safe in
such a nasty business, you might apply to the man Fenn.&nbsp; You
might even, I think, use the Viscount&rsquo;s name; and the
little trick of family resemblance might come in.&nbsp; How, for
instance, if you were to call yourself his brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It might be done,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But look
here a moment?&nbsp; You propose to me a very difficult game: I
have apparently a devil of an opponent in my cousin; and, being a
prisoner of war, I can scarcely be said to hold good cards.&nbsp;
For what stakes, then, am I playing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are very large,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
great-uncle is immensely rich&mdash;immensely rich.&nbsp; He was
wise in time; he smelt the revolution long before; sold all that
he could, and had all that was movable transported to England
through my firm.&nbsp; There are considerable estates in England;
Amersham Place itself is very fine; and he has much money, wisely
invested.&nbsp; He lives, indeed, like a prince.&nbsp; And of
what use is it to him?&nbsp; He has lost all that was worth
living for&mdash;his family, his country; he has seen his king
and queen murdered; he has seen all these miseries and
infamies,&rsquo; pursued the lawyer, with a rising inflection and
a heightening colour; and then broke suddenly
off,&mdash;&lsquo;In short, sir, he has seen all the advantages
of that government for which his nephew carries arms, and he has
the misfortune not to like them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You speak with a bitterness that I suppose I must
excuse,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;yet which of us has the more reason
to be bitter?&nbsp; This man, my uncle, M. de K&eacute;roual,
fled.&nbsp; My parents, who were less wise perhaps,
remained.&nbsp; In the beginning, they were even republicans; to
the end they could not be persuaded to despair of the
people.&nbsp; It was a glorious folly, for which, as a son, I
reverence them.&nbsp; First one and then the other
perished.&nbsp; If I have any mark of a gentleman, all who taught
me died upon the scaffold, and my last school of manners was the
prison of the Abbaye.&nbsp; Do you think you can teach bitterness
to a man with a history like mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no wish to try,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
yet there is one point I cannot understand: I cannot understand
that one of your blood and experience should serve the
Corsican.&nbsp; I cannot understand it: it seems as though
everything generous in you must rise against
that&mdash;domination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And perhaps,&rsquo; I retorted, &lsquo;had your
childhood passed among wolves, you would have been overjoyed
yourself to see the Corsican Shepherd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; replied Mr. Romaine, &lsquo;it may
be.&nbsp; There are things that do not bear
discussion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with a wave of his hand he disappeared abruptly down a
flight of steps and under the shadow of a ponderous arch.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V&mdash;ST. IVES IS SHOWN A HOUSE</h2>
<p>The lawyer was scarce gone before I remembered many omissions;
and chief among these, that I had neglected to get Mr. Burchell
Fenn&rsquo;s address.&nbsp; Here was an essential point
neglected; and I ran to the head of the stairs to find myself
already too late.&nbsp; The lawyer was beyond my view; in the
archway that led downward to the castle gate, only the red coat
and the bright arms of a sentry glittered in the shadow; and I
could but return to my place upon the ramparts.</p>
<p>I am not very sure that I was properly entitled to this
corner.&nbsp; But I was a high favourite; not an officer, and
scarce a private, in the castle would have turned me back, except
upon a thing of moment; and whenever I desired to be solitary, I
was suffered to sit here behind my piece of cannon
unmolested.&nbsp; The cliff went down before me almost sheer, but
mantled with a thicket of climbing trees; from farther down, an
outwork raised its turret; and across the valley I had a view of
that long terrace of Princes Street which serves as a promenade
to the fashionable inhabitants of Edinburgh.&nbsp; A singularity
in a military prison, that it should command a view on the chief
thoroughfare!</p>
<p>It is not necessary that I should trouble you with the train
of my reflections, which turned upon the interview I had just
concluded and the hopes that were now opening before me.&nbsp;
What is more essential, my eye (even while I thought) kept
following the movement of the passengers on Princes Street, as
they passed briskly to and fro&mdash;met, greeted, and bowed to
each other&mdash;or entered and left the shops, which are in that
quarter, and, for a town of the Britannic provinces, particularly
fine.&nbsp; My mind being busy upon other things, the course of
my eye was the more random; and it chanced that I followed, for
some time, the advance of a young gentleman with a red head and a
white great-coat, for whom I cared nothing at the moment, and of
whom it is probable I shall be gathered to my fathers without
learning more.&nbsp; He seemed to have a large acquaintance: his
hat was for ever in his hand; and I daresay I had already
observed him exchanging compliments with half a dozen, when he
drew up at last before a young man and a young lady whose tall
persons and gallant carriage I thought I recognised.</p>
<p>It was impossible at such a distance that I could be sure, but
the thought was sufficient, and I craned out of the embrasure to
follow them as long as possible.&nbsp; To think that such
emotions, that such a concussion of the blood, may have been
inspired by a chance resemblance, and that I may have stood and
thrilled there for a total stranger!&nbsp; This distant view, at
least, whether of Flora or of some one else, changed in a moment
the course of my reflections.&nbsp; It was all very well, and it
was highly needful, I should see my uncle; but an uncle, a
great-uncle at that, and one whom I had never seen, leaves the
imagination cold; and if I were to leave the castle, I might
never again have the opportunity of finding Flora.&nbsp; The
little impression I had made, even supposing I had made any, how
soon it would die out! how soon I should sink to be a phantom
memory, with which (in after days) she might amuse a husband and
children!&nbsp; No, the impression must be clenched, the wax
impressed with the seal, ere I left Edinburgh.&nbsp; And at this
the two interests that were now contending in my bosom came
together and became one.&nbsp; I wished to see Flora again; and I
wanted some one to further me in my flight and to get me new
clothes.&nbsp; The conclusion was apparent.&nbsp; Except for
persons in the garrison itself, with whom it was a point of
honour and military duty to retain me captive, I knew, in the
whole country of Scotland, these two alone.&nbsp; If it were to
be done at all, they must be my helpers.&nbsp; To tell them of my
designed escape while I was still in bonds, would be to lay
before them a most difficult choice.&nbsp; What they might do in
such a case, I could not in the least be sure of, for (the same
case arising) I was far from sure what I should do myself.&nbsp;
It was plain I must escape first.&nbsp; When the harm was done,
when I was no more than a poor wayside fugitive, I might apply to
them with less offence and more security.&nbsp; To this end it
became necessary that I should find out where they lived and how
to reach it; and feeling a strong confidence that they would soon
return to visit me, I prepared a series of baits with which to
angle for my information.&nbsp; It will be seen the first was
good enough.</p>
<p>Perhaps two days after, Master Ronald put in an appearance by
himself.&nbsp; I had no hold upon the boy, and pretermitted my
design till I should have laid court to him and engaged his
interest.&nbsp; He was prodigiously embarrassed, not having
previously addressed me otherwise than by a bow and blushes; and
he advanced to me with an air of one stubbornly performing a
duty, like a raw soldier under fire.&nbsp; I laid down my
carving; greeted him with a good deal of formality, such as I
thought he would enjoy; and finding him to remain silent,
branched off into narratives of my campaigns such as Goguelat
himself might have scrupled to endorse.&nbsp; He visibly thawed
and brightened; drew more near to where I sat; forgot his
timidity so far as to put many questions; and at last, with
another blush, informed me he was himself expecting a
commission.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;they are fine troops, your
British troops in the Peninsula.&nbsp; A young gentleman of
spirit may well be proud to be engaged at the head of such
soldiers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I think of nothing
else.&nbsp; I think shame to be dangling here at home and going
through with this foolery of education, while others, no older
than myself, are in the field.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot blame you,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
felt the same myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are&mdash;there are no troops, are there, quite
so good as ours?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;there is a point about
them: they have a defect,&mdash;they are not to be trusted in a
retreat.&nbsp; I have seen them behave very ill in a
retreat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe that is our national character,&rsquo; he
said&mdash;God forgive him!&mdash;with an air of pride.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen your national character running away at
least, and had the honour to run after it!&rsquo; rose to my
lips, but I was not so ill advised as to give it utterance.&nbsp;
Every one should be flattered, but boys and women without stint;
and I put in the rest of the afternoon narrating to him tales of
British heroism, for which I should not like to engage that they
were all true.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite surprised,&rsquo; he said at last.&nbsp;
&lsquo;People tell you the French are insincere.&nbsp; Now, I
think your sincerity is beautiful.&nbsp; I think you have a noble
character.&nbsp; I admire you very much.&nbsp; I am very grateful
for your kindness to&mdash;to one so young,&rsquo; and he offered
me his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall see you again soon?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, now!&nbsp; Yes, very soon,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&mdash;I wish to tell you.&nbsp; I would not let
Flora&mdash;Miss Gilchrist, I mean&mdash;come to-day.&nbsp; I
wished to see more of you myself.&nbsp; I trust you are not
offended: you know, one should be careful about
strangers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I approved his caution, and he took himself away: leaving me
in a mixture of contrarious feelings, part ashamed to have played
on one so gullible, part raging that I should have burned so much
incense before the vanity of England; yet, in the bottom of my
soul, delighted to think I had made a friend&mdash;or, at least,
begun to make a friend&mdash;of Flora&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>As I had half expected, both made their appearance the next
day.&nbsp; I struck so fine a shade betwixt the pride that is
allowed to soldiers and the sorrowful humility that befits a
captive, that I declare, as I went to meet them, I might have
afforded a subject for a painter.&nbsp; So much was high comedy,
I must confess; but so soon as my eyes lighted full on her dark
face and eloquent eyes, the blood leaped into my cheeks&mdash;and
that was nature!&nbsp; I thanked them, but not the least with
exultation; it was my cue to be mournful, and to take the pair of
them as one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been thinking,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you have
been so good to me, both of you, stranger and prisoner as I am,
that I have been thinking how I could testify to my
gratitude.&nbsp; It may seem a strange subject for a confidence,
but there is actually no one here, even of my comrades, that
knows me by my name and title.&nbsp; By these I am called plain
Champdivers, a name to which I have a right, but not the name
which I should bear, and which (but a little while ago) I must
hide like a crime.&nbsp; Miss Flora, suffer me to present to you
the Vicomte Anne de K&eacute;roual de Saint-Yves, a private
soldier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew it!&rsquo; cried the boy; &lsquo;I knew he was a
noble!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I thought the eyes of Miss Flora said the same, but more
persuasively.&nbsp; All through this interview she kept them on
the ground, or only gave them to me for a moment at a time, and
with a serious sweetness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may conceive, my friends, that this is rather a
painful confession,&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;To stand
here before you, vanquished, a prisoner in a fortress, and take
my own name upon my lips, is painful to the proud.&nbsp; And yet
I wished that you should know me.&nbsp; Long after this, we may
yet hear of one another&mdash;perhaps Mr. Gilchrist and myself in
the field and from opposing camps&mdash;and it would be a pity if
we heard and did not recognise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were both moved; and began at once to press upon me
offers of service, such as to lend me books, get me tobacco if I
used it, and the like.&nbsp; This would have been all mighty
welcome, before the tunnel was ready.&nbsp; Now it signified no
more to me than to offer the transition I required.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear friends,&rsquo; I said&mdash;&lsquo;for you
must allow me to call you that, who have no others within so many
hundred leagues&mdash;perhaps you will think me fanciful and
sentimental; and perhaps indeed I am; but there is one service
that I would beg of you before all others.&nbsp; You see me set
here on the top of this rock in the midst of your city.&nbsp;
Even with what liberty I have, I have the opportunity to see a
myriad roofs, and I dare to say, thirty leagues of sea and
land.&nbsp; All this hostile!&nbsp; Under all these roofs my
enemies dwell; wherever I see the smoke of a house rising, I must
tell myself that some one sits before the chimney and reads with
joy of our reverses.&nbsp; Pardon me, dear friends, I know that
you must do the same, and I do not grudge at it!&nbsp; With you,
it is all different.&nbsp; Show me your house then, were it only
the chimney, or, if that be not visible, the quarter of the town
in which it lies!&nbsp; So, when I look all about me, I shall be
able to say: &ldquo;<i>There is one house in which I am not quite
unkindly thought of</i>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Flora stood a moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a pretty thought,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and, as
far as regards Ronald and myself, a true one.&nbsp; Come, I
believe I can show you the very smoke out of our
chimney.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying, she carried me round the battlements towards the
opposite or southern side of the fortress, and indeed to a
bastion almost immediately overlooking the place of our projected
flight.&nbsp; Thence we had a view of some foreshortened suburbs
at our feet, and beyond of a green, open, and irregular country
rising towards the Pentland Hills.&nbsp; The face of one of these
summits (say two leagues from where we stood) is marked with a
procession of white scars.&nbsp; And to this she directed my
attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see these marks?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
call them the Seven Sisters.&nbsp; Follow a little lower with
your eye, and you will see a fold of the hill, the tops of some
trees, and a tail of smoke out of the midst of them.&nbsp; That
is Swanston Cottage, where my brother and I are living with my
aunt.&nbsp; If it gives you pleasure to see it, I am glad.&nbsp;
We, too, can see the castle from a corner in the garden, and we
go there in the morning often&mdash;do we not, Ronald?&mdash;and
we think of you, M. de Saint-Yves; but I am afraid it does not
altogether make us glad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mademoiselle!&rsquo; said I, and indeed my voice was
scarce under command, &lsquo;if you knew how your generous
words&mdash;how even the sight of you&mdash;relieved the horrors
of this place, I believe, I hope, I know, you would be
glad.&nbsp; I will come here daily and look at that dear chimney
and these green hills, and bless you from the heart, and dedicate
to you the prayers of this poor sinner.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; I do not
say they can avail!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who can say that, M. de Saint-Yves?&rsquo; she said
softly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I think it is time we should be
going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;High time,&rsquo; said Ronald, whom (to say the truth)
I had a little forgotten.</p>
<p>On the way back, as I was laying myself out to recover lost
ground with the youth, and to obliterate, if possible, the memory
of my last and somewhat too fervent speech, who should come past
us but the major?&nbsp; I had to stand aside and salute as he
went by, but his eyes appeared entirely occupied with Flora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is that man?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a friend of mine,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
give him lessons in French, and he has been very kind to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He stared,&rsquo; she said,&mdash;&lsquo;I do not say,
rudely; but why should he stare?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you do not wish to be stared at, mademoiselle,
suffer me to recommend a veil,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>She looked at me with what seemed anger.&nbsp; &lsquo;I tell
you the man stared,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>And Ronald added.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think he
meant any harm.&nbsp; I suppose he was just surprised to see us
walking about with a pr--- with M. Saint-Yves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the next morning, when I went to Chevenix&rsquo;s rooms,
and after I had dutifully corrected his exercise&mdash;&lsquo;I
compliment you on your taste,&rsquo; said he to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, I beg yours,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
understand me perfectly, just as I do you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I murmured something about enigmas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, shall I give you the key to the enigma?&rsquo;
said he, leaning back.&nbsp; &lsquo;That was the young lady whom
Goguelat insulted and whom you avenged.&nbsp; I do not blame
you.&nbsp; She is a heavenly creature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all my heart, to the last of it!&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;And to the first also, if it amuses you!&nbsp;
You are become so very acute of late that I suppose you must have
your own way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is her name?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, really!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think
it likely she has told me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it certain,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>I could not restrain my laughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, then, do
you think it likely I would tell you?&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit.&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;But come, to
our lesson!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE ESCAPE</h2>
<p>The time for our escape drew near, and the nearer it came the
less we seemed to enjoy the prospect.&nbsp; There is but one side
on which this castle can be left either with dignity or safety;
but as there is the main gate and guard, and the chief street of
the upper city, it is not to be thought of by escaping
prisoners.&nbsp; In all other directions an abominable precipice
surrounds it, down the face of which (if anywhere at all) we must
regain our liberty.&nbsp; By our concurrent labours in many a
dark night, working with the most anxious precautions against
noise, we had made out to pierce below the curtain about the
south-west corner, in a place they call the <i>Devil&rsquo;s
Elbow</i>.&nbsp; I have never met that celebrity; nor (if the
rest of him at all comes up to what they called his elbow) have I
the least desire of his acquaintance.&nbsp; From the heel of the
masonry, the rascally, breakneck precipice descended sheer among
waste lands, scattered suburbs of the city, and houses in the
building.&nbsp; I had never the heart to look for any length of
time&mdash;the thought that I must make the descent in person
some dark night robbing me of breath; and, indeed, on anybody not
a seaman or a steeple-jack, the mere sight of the
<i>Devil&rsquo;s Elbow</i> wrought like an emetic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the rope was got, and doubt if I much
cared.&nbsp; It was not that which gravelled me, but whether, now
that we had it, it would serve our turn.&nbsp; Its length,
indeed, we made a shift to fathom out; but who was to tell us how
that length compared with the way we had to go?&nbsp; Day after
day, there would be always some of us stolen out to the
<i>Devil&rsquo;s Elbow</i> and making estimates of the descent,
whether by a bare guess or the dropping of stones.&nbsp; A
private of pioneers remembered the formula for that&mdash;or else
remembered part of it and obligingly invented the
remainder.&nbsp; I had never any real confidence in that formula;
and even had we got it from a book, there were difficulties in
the way of the application that might have daunted
Archimedes.&nbsp; We durst not drop any considerable pebble lest
the sentinels should hear, and those that we dropped we could not
hear ourselves.&nbsp; We had never a watch&mdash;or none that had
a second-hand; and though every one of us could guess a second to
a nicety, all somehow guessed it differently.&nbsp; In short, if
any two set forth upon this enterprise, they invariably returned
with two opinions, and often with a black eye in the
bargain.&nbsp; I looked on upon these proceedings, although not
without laughter, yet with impatience and disgust.&nbsp; I am one
that cannot bear to see things botched or gone upon with
ignorance; and the thought that some poor devil was to hazard his
bones upon such premises, revolted me.&nbsp; Had I guessed the
name of that unhappy first adventurer, my sentiments might have
been livelier still.</p>
<p>The designation of this personage was indeed all that remained
for us to do; and even in that we had advanced so far that the
lot had fallen on Shed B.&nbsp; It had been determined to mingle
the bitter and the sweet; and whoever went down first, the whole
of his shed-mates were to follow next in order.&nbsp; This caused
a good deal of joy in Shed B, and would have caused more if it
had not still remained to choose our pioneer.&nbsp; In view of
the ambiguity in which we lay as to the length of the rope and
the height of the precipice&mdash;and that this gentleman was to
climb down from fifty to seventy fathoms on a pitchy night, on a
rope entirely free, and with not so much as an infant child to
steady it at the bottom, a little backwardness was perhaps
excusable.&nbsp; But it was, in our case, more than a
little.&nbsp; The truth is, we were all womanish fellows about a
height; and I have myself been put, more than once, <i>hors de
combat</i> by a less affair than the rock of Edinburgh
Castle.</p>
<p>We discussed it in the dark and between the passage of the
rounds; and it was impossible for any body of men to show a less
adventurous spirit.&nbsp; I am sure some of us, and myself first
among the number, regretted Goguelat.&nbsp; Some were persuaded
it was safe, and could prove the same by argument; but if they
had good reasons why some one else should make the trial, they
had better still why it should not be themselves.&nbsp; Others,
again, condemned the whole idea as insane; among these, as
ill-luck would have it, a seaman of the fleet; who was the most
dispiriting of all.&nbsp; The height, he reminded us, was greater
than the tallest ship&rsquo;s mast, the rope entirely free; and
he as good as defied the boldest and strongest to succeed.&nbsp;
We were relieved from this dead-lock by our sergeant-major of
dragoons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Comrades,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I believe I rank you
all; and for that reason, if you really wish it, I will be the
first myself.&nbsp; At the same time, you are to consider what
the chances are that I may prove to be the last, as well.&nbsp; I
am no longer young&mdash;I was sixty near a month ago.&nbsp;
Since I have been a prisoner, I have made for myself a little
<i>bedaine</i>.&nbsp; My arms are all gone to fat.&nbsp; And you
must promise not to blame me, if I fall and play the devil with
the whole thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We cannot hear of such a thing!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;M. Laclas is the oldest man here; and, as such, he should
be the very last to offer.&nbsp; It is plain, we must draw
lots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said M. Laclas; &lsquo;you put something
else in my head!&nbsp; There is one here who owes a pretty candle
to the others, for they have kept his secret.&nbsp; Besides, the
rest of us are only rabble; and he is another affair
altogether.&nbsp; Let Champdivers&mdash;let the noble go the
first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I confess there was a notable pause before the noble in
question got his voice.&nbsp; But there was no room for
choice.&nbsp; I had been so ill-advised, when I first joined the
regiment, as to take ground on my nobility.&nbsp; I had been
often rallied on the matter in the ranks, and had passed under
the by-names of <i>Monseigneur</i> and <i>the Marquis</i>.&nbsp;
It was now needful I should justify myself and take a fair
revenge.</p>
<p>Any little hesitation I may have felt passed entirely
unnoticed, from the lucky incident of a round happening at that
moment to go by.&nbsp; And during the interval of silence there
occurred something that sent my blood to the boil.&nbsp; There
was a private in our shed called Clausel, a man of a very ugly
disposition.&nbsp; He had made one of the followers of Goguelat;
but, whereas Goguelat had always a kind of monstrous gaiety about
him, Clausel was no less morose than he was evil-minded.&nbsp; He
was sometimes called <i>the General</i>, and sometimes by a name
too ill-mannered for repetition.&nbsp; As we all sat listening,
this man&rsquo;s hand was laid on my shoulder, and his voice
whispered in my ear: &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ll
have you hanged, Marquis!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the round was past&mdash;&lsquo;Certainly,
gentlemen!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will give you a lead,
with all the pleasure in the world.&nbsp; But, first of all,
there is a hound here to be punished.&nbsp; M. Clausel has just
insulted me, and dishonoured the French army; and I demand that
he run the gauntlet of this shed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was but one voice asking what he had done, and, as soon
as I had told them, but one voice agreeing to the
punishment.&nbsp; The General was, in consequence, extremely
roughly handled, and the next day was congratulated by all who
saw him on his <i>new decorations</i>.&nbsp; It was lucky for us
that he was one of the prime movers and believers in our project
of escape, or he had certainly revenged himself by a
denunciation.&nbsp; As for his feelings towards myself, they
appeared, by his looks, to surpass humanity; and I made up my
mind to give him a wide berth in the future.</p>
<p>Had I been to go down that instant, I believe I could have
carried it well.&nbsp; But it was already too late&mdash;the day
was at hand.&nbsp; The rest had still to be summoned.&nbsp; Nor
was this the extent of my misfortune; for the next night, and the
night after, were adorned with a perfect galaxy of stars, and
showed every cat that stirred in a quarter of a mile.&nbsp;
During this interval, I have to direct your sympathies on the
Vicomte de Saint-Yves!&nbsp; All addressed me softly, like folk
round a sickbed.&nbsp; Our Italian corporal, who had got a dozen
of oysters from a fishwife, laid them at my feet, as though I
were a Pagan idol; and I have never since been wholly at my ease
in the society of shellfish.&nbsp; He who was the best of our
carvers brought me a snuff-box, which he had just completed, and
which, while it was yet in hand, he had often declared he would
not part with under fifteen dollars.&nbsp; I believe the piece
was worth the money too!&nbsp; And yet the voice stuck in my
throat with which I must thank him.&nbsp; I found myself, in a
word, to be fed up like a prisoner in a camp of anthropophagi,
and honoured like the sacrificial bull.&nbsp; And what with these
annoyances, and the risky venture immediately ahead, I found my
part a trying one to play.</p>
<p>It was a good deal of a relief when the third evening closed
about the castle with volumes of sea-fog.&nbsp; The lights of
Princes Street sometimes disappeared, sometimes blinked across at
us no brighter than the eyes of cats; and five steps from one of
the lanterns on the ramparts it was already groping dark.&nbsp;
We made haste to lie down.&nbsp; Had our jailers been upon the
watch, they must have observed our conversation to die out
unusually soon.&nbsp; Yet I doubt if any of us slept.&nbsp; Each
lay in his place, tortured at once with the hope of liberty and
the fear of a hateful death.&nbsp; The guard call sounded; the
hum of the town declined by little and little.&nbsp; On all sides
of us, in their different quarters, we could hear the watchman
cry the hours along the street.&nbsp; Often enough, during my
stay in England, have I listened to these gruff or broken voices;
or perhaps gone to my window when I lay sleepless, and watched
the old gentleman hobble by upon the causeway with his cape and
his cap, his hanger and his rattle.&nbsp; It was ever a thought
with me how differently that cry would re-echo in the chamber of
lovers, beside the bed of death, or in the condemned cell.&nbsp;
I might be said to hear it that night myself in the condemned
cell!&nbsp; At length a fellow with a voice like a bull&rsquo;s
began to roar out in the opposite thoroughfare:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Past yin o&rsquo;cloak, and a dark, haary
moarnin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At which we were all silently afoot.</p>
<p>As I stole about the battlements towards the&mdash;gallows, I
was about to write&mdash;the sergeant-major, perhaps doubtful of
my resolution, kept close by me, and occasionally proffered the
most indigestible reassurances in my ear.&nbsp; At last I could
bear them no longer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be so obliging as to let me be!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am neither a coward nor a fool.&nbsp; What do <i>you</i>
know of whether the rope be long enough?&nbsp; But I shall know
it in ten minutes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The good old fellow laughed in his moustache, and patted
me.</p>
<p>It was all very well to show the disposition of my temper
before a friend alone; before my assembled comrades the thing had
to go handsomely.&nbsp; It was then my time to come on the stage;
and I hope I took it handsomely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, gentlemen,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if the rope is
ready, here is the criminal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tunnel was cleared, the stake driven, the rope
extended.&nbsp; As I moved forward to the place, many of my
comrades caught me by the hand and wrung it, an attention I could
well have done without.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep an eye on Clausel!&rsquo; I whispered to Laclas;
and with that, got down on my elbows and knees took the rope in
both hands, and worked myself, feet foremost, through the
tunnel.&nbsp; When the earth failed under my feet, I thought my
heart would have stopped; and a moment after I was demeaning
myself in mid-air like a drunken jumping-jack.&nbsp; I have never
been a model of piety, but at this juncture prayers and a cold
sweat burst from me simultaneously.</p>
<p>The line was knotted at intervals of eighteen inches; and to
the inexpert it may seem as if it should have been even easy to
descend.&nbsp; The trouble was, this devil of a piece of rope
appeared to be inspired, not with life alone, but with a personal
malignity against myself.&nbsp; It turned to the one side, paused
for a moment, and then spun me like a toasting-jack to the other;
slipped like an eel from the clasp of my feet; kept me all the
time in the most outrageous fury of exertion; and dashed me at
intervals against the face of the rock.&nbsp; I had no eyes to
see with; and I doubt if there was anything to see but
darkness.&nbsp; I must occasionally have caught a gasp of breath,
but it was quite unconscious.&nbsp; And the whole forces of my
mind were so consumed with losing hold and getting it again, that
I could scarce have told whether I was going up or coming
down.</p>
<p>Of a sudden I knocked against the cliff with such a thump as
almost bereft me of my sense; and, as reason twinkled back, I was
amazed to find that I was in a state of rest, that the face of
the precipice here inclined outwards at an angle which relieved
me almost wholly of the burthen of my own weight, and that one of
my feet was safely planted on a ledge.&nbsp; I drew one of the
sweetest breaths in my experience, hugged myself against the
rope, and closed my eyes in a kind of ecstasy of relief.&nbsp; It
occurred to me next to see how far I was advanced on my unlucky
journey, a point on which I had not a shadow of a guess.&nbsp; I
looked up: there was nothing above me but the blackness of the
night and the fog.&nbsp; I craned timidly forward and looked
down.&nbsp; There, upon a floor of darkness, I beheld a certain
pattern of hazy lights, some of them aligned as in thoroughfares,
others standing apart as in solitary houses; and before I could
well realise it, or had in the least estimated my distance, a
wave of nausea and vertigo warned me to lie back and close my
eyes.&nbsp; In this situation I had really but the one wish, and
that was: something else to think of!&nbsp; Strange to say, I got
it: a veil was torn from my mind, and I saw what a fool I
was&mdash;what fools we had all been&mdash;and that I had no
business to be thus dangling between earth and heaven by my
arms.&nbsp; The only thing to have done was to have attached me
to a rope and lowered me, and I had never the wit to see it till
that moment!</p>
<p>I filled my lungs, got a good hold on my rope, and once more
launched myself on the descent.&nbsp; As it chanced, the worst of
the danger was at an end, and I was so fortunate as to be never
again exposed to any violent concussion.&nbsp; Soon after I must
have passed within a little distance of a bush of wallflower, for
the scent of it came over me with that impression of reality
which characterises scents in darkness.&nbsp; This made me a
second landmark, the ledge being my first.&nbsp; I began
accordingly to compute intervals of time: so much to the ledge,
so much again to the wallflower, so much more below.&nbsp; If I
were not at the bottom of the rock, I calculated I must be near
indeed to the end of the rope, and there was no doubt that I was
not far from the end of my own resources.&nbsp; I began to be
light-headed and to be tempted to let go,&mdash;now arguing that
I was certainly arrived within a few feet of the level and could
safely risk a fall, anon persuaded I was still close at the top
and it was idle to continue longer on the rock.&nbsp; In the
midst of which I came to a bearing on plain ground, and had
nearly wept aloud.&nbsp; My hands were as good as flayed, my
courage entirely exhausted, and, what with the long strain and
the sudden relief, my limbs shook under me with more than the
violence of ague, and I was glad to cling to the rope.</p>
<p>But this was no time to give way.&nbsp; I had (by God&rsquo;s
single mercy) got myself alive out of that fortress; and now I
had to try to get the others, my comrades.&nbsp; There was about
a fathom of rope to spare; I got it by the end, and searched the
whole ground thoroughly for anything to make it fast to.&nbsp; In
vain: the ground was broken and stony, but there grew not there
so much as a bush of furze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now then,&rsquo; thought I to myself, &lsquo;here
begins a new lesson, and I believe it will prove richer than the
first.&nbsp; I am not strong enough to keep this rope
extended.&nbsp; If I do not keep it extended the next man will be
dashed against the precipice.&nbsp; There is no reason why he
should have my extravagant good luck.&nbsp; I see no reason why
he should not fall&mdash;nor any place for him to fall on but my
head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From where I was now standing there was occasionally visible,
as the fog lightened, a lamp in one of the barrack windows, which
gave me a measure of the height he had to fall and the horrid
force that he must strike me with.&nbsp; What was yet worse, we
had agreed to do without signals: every so many minutes by
Laclas&rsquo; watch another man was to be started from the
battlements.&nbsp; Now, I had seemed to myself to be about half
an hour in my descent, and it seemed near as long again that I
waited, straining on the rope for my next comrade to begin.&nbsp;
I began to be afraid that our conspiracy was out, that my friends
were all secured, and that I should pass the remainder of the
night, and be discovered in the morning, vainly clinging to the
rope&rsquo;s end like a hooked fish upon an angle.&nbsp; I could
not refrain, at this ridiculous image, from a chuckle of
laughter.&nbsp; And the next moment I knew, by the jerking of the
rope, that my friend had crawled out of the tunnel and was fairly
launched on his descent.&nbsp; It appears it was the sailor who
had insisted on succeeding me: as soon as my continued silence
had assured him the rope was long enough, Gautier, for that was
his name, had forgot his former arguments, and shown himself so
extremely forward, that Laclas had given way.&nbsp; It was like
the fellow, who had no harm in him beyond an instinctive
selfishness.&nbsp; But he was like to have paid pretty dearly for
the privilege.&nbsp; Do as I would, I could not keep the rope as
I could have wished it; and he ended at last by falling on me
from a height of several yards, so that we both rolled together
on the ground.&nbsp; As soon as he could breathe he cursed me
beyond belief, wept over his finger, which he had broken, and
cursed me again.&nbsp; I bade him be still and think shame of
himself to be so great a cry-baby.&nbsp; Did he not hear the
round going by above? I asked; and who could tell but what the
noise of his fall was already remarked, and the sentinels at the
very moment leaning upon the battlements to listen?</p>
<p>The round, however, went by, and nothing was discovered; the
third man came to the ground quite easily; the fourth was, of
course, child&rsquo;s play; and before there were ten of us
collected, it seemed to me that, without the least injustice to
my comrades, I might proceed to take care of myself.</p>
<p>I knew their plan: they had a map and an almanack, and
designed for Grangemouth, where they were to steal a ship.&nbsp;
Suppose them to do so, I had no idea they were qualified to
manage it after it was stolen.&nbsp; Their whole escape, indeed,
was the most haphazard thing imaginable; only the impatience of
captives and the ignorance of private soldiers would have
entertained so misbegotten a device; and though I played the good
comrade and worked with them upon the tunnel, but for the
lawyer&rsquo;s message I should have let them go without
me.&nbsp; Well, now they were beyond my help, as they had always
been beyond my counselling; and, without word said or leave
taken, I stole out of the little crowd.&nbsp; It is true I would
rather have waited to shake hands with Laclas, but in the last
man who had descended I thought I recognised Clausel, and since
the scene in the shed my distrust of Clausel was perfect.&nbsp; I
believed the man to be capable of any infamy, and events have
since shown that I was right.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII&mdash;SWANSTON COTTAGE</h2>
<p>I had two views.&nbsp; The first was, naturally, to get clear
of Edinburgh Castle and the town, to say nothing of my
fellow-prisoners; the second to work to the southward so long as
it was night, and be near Swanston Cottage by morning.&nbsp; What
I should do there and then, I had no guess, and did not greatly
care, being a devotee of a couple of divinities called Chance and
Circumstance.&nbsp; Prepare, if possible; where it is impossible,
work straight forward, and keep your eyes open and your tongue
oiled.&nbsp; Wit and a good exterior&mdash;there is all life in a
nutshell.</p>
<p>I had at first a rather chequered journey: got involved in
gardens, butted into houses, and had even once the misfortune to
awake a sleeping family, the father of which, as I suppose,
menaced me from the window with a blunderbuss.&nbsp; Altogether,
though I had been some time gone from my companions, I was still
at no great distance, when a miserable accident put a period to
the escape.&nbsp; Of a sudden the night was divided by a
scream.&nbsp; This was followed by the sound of something
falling, and that again by the report of a musket from the Castle
battlements.&nbsp; It was strange to hear the alarm spread
through the city.&nbsp; In the fortress drums were beat and a
bell rung backward.&nbsp; On all hands the watchmen sprang their
rattles.&nbsp; Even in that limbo or no-man&rsquo;s-land where I
was wandering, lights were made in the houses; sashes were flung
up; I could hear neighbouring families converse from window to
window, and at length I was challenged myself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wha&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; cried a big voice.</p>
<p>I could see it proceeded from a big man in a big nightcap,
leaning from a one-pair window; and as I was not yet abreast of
his house, I judged it was more wise to answer.&nbsp; This was
not the first time I had had to stake my fortunes on the goodness
of my accent in a foreign tongue; and I have always found the
moment inspiriting, as a gambler should.&nbsp; Pulling around me
a sort of great-coat I had made of my blanket, to cover my
sulphur-coloured livery,&mdash;&lsquo;A friend!&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What like&rsquo;s all this collieshangie?&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>I had never heard of a collieshangie in my days, but with the
racket all about us in the city, I could have no doubt as to the
man&rsquo;s meaning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know, sir, really,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but I
suppose some of the prisoners will have escaped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bedamned!&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, sir, they will be soon taken,&rsquo; I replied:
&lsquo;it has been found in time.&nbsp; Good morning,
sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye walk late, sir?&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, surely not,&rsquo; said I, with a laugh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Earlyish, if you like!&rsquo; which brought me finally
beyond him, highly pleased with my success.</p>
<p>I was now come forth on a good thoroughfare, which led (as
well as I could judge) in my direction.&nbsp; It brought me
almost immediately through a piece of street, whence I could hear
close by the springing of a watchman&rsquo;s rattle, and where I
suppose a sixth part of the windows would be open, and the
people, in all sorts of night gear, talking with a kind of tragic
gusto from one to another.&nbsp; Here, again, I must run the
gauntlet of a half-dozen questions, the rattle all the while
sounding nearer; but as I was not walking inordinately quick, as
I spoke like a gentleman, and the lamps were too dim to show my
dress, I carried it off once more.&nbsp; One person, indeed,
inquired where I was off to at that hour.</p>
<p>I replied vaguely and cheerfully, and as I escaped at one end
of this dangerous pass I could see the watchman&rsquo;s lantern
entering by the other.&nbsp; I was now safe on a dark country
highway, out of sight of lights and out of the fear of
watchmen.&nbsp; And yet I had not gone above a hundred yards
before a fellow made an ugly rush at me from the roadside.&nbsp;
I avoided him with a leap, and stood on guard, cursing my empty
hands, wondering whether I had to do with an officer or a mere
footpad, and scarce knowing which to wish.&nbsp; My assailant
stood a little; in the thick darkness I could see him bob and
sidle as though he were feinting at me for an advantageous
onfall.&nbsp; Then he spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My goo&rsquo; frien&rsquo;,&rsquo; says he, and at the
first word I pricked my ears, &lsquo;my goo&rsquo; frien&rsquo;,
will you oblishe me with lil neshary infamation?&nbsp; Whish
roa&rsquo; t&rsquo; Cramond?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I laughed out clear and loud, stepped up to the convivialist,
took him by the shoulders and faced him about.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
good friend,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I believe I know what is best
for you much better than yourself, and may God forgive you the
fright you have given me!&nbsp; There, get you gone to
Edinburgh!&rsquo;&nbsp; And I gave a shove, which he obeyed with
the passive agility of a ball, and disappeared incontinently in
the darkness down the road by which I had myself come.</p>
<p>Once clear of this foolish fellow, I went on again up a
gradual hill, descended on the other side through the houses of a
country village, and came at last to the bottom of the main
ascent leading to the Pentlands and my destination.&nbsp; I was
some way up when the fog began to lighten; a little farther, and
I stepped by degrees into a clear starry night, and saw in front
of me, and quite distinct, the summits of the Pentlands, and
behind, the valley of the Forth and the city of my late captivity
buried under a lake of vapour.&nbsp; I had but one
encounter&mdash;that of a farm-cart, which I heard, from a great
way ahead of me, creaking nearer in the night, and which passed
me about the point of dawn like a thing seen in a dream, with two
silent figures in the inside nodding to the horse&rsquo;s
steps.&nbsp; I presume they were asleep; by the shawl about her
head and shoulders, one of them should be a woman.&nbsp; Soon, by
concurrent steps, the day began to break and the fog to subside
and roll away.&nbsp; The east grew luminous and was barred with
chilly colours, and the Castle on its rock, and the spires and
chimneys of the upper town, took gradual shape, and arose, like
islands, out of the receding cloud.&nbsp; All about me was still
and sylvan; the road mounting and winding, with nowhere a sign of
any passenger, the birds chirping, I suppose for warmth, the
boughs of the trees knocking together, and the red leaves falling
in the wind.</p>
<p>It was broad day, but still bitter cold and the sun not up,
when I came in view of my destination.&nbsp; A single gable and
chimney of the cottage peeped over the shoulder of the hill; not
far off, and a trifle higher on the mountain, a tall old
white-washed farmhouse stood among the trees, beside a falling
brook; beyond were rough hills of pasture.&nbsp; I bethought me
that shepherd folk were early risers, and if I were once seen
skulking in that neighbourhood it might prove the ruin of my
prospects; took advantage of a line of hedge, and worked myself
up in its shadow till I was come under the garden wall of my
friends&rsquo; house.&nbsp; The cottage was a little quaint place
of many rough-cast gables and grey roofs.&nbsp; It had something
the air of a rambling infinitesimal cathedral, the body of it
rising in the midst two storeys high, with a steep-pitched roof,
and sending out upon all hands (as it were chapter-houses,
chapels, and transepts) one-storeyed and dwarfish
projections.&nbsp; To add to this appearance, it was grotesquely
decorated with crockets and gargoyles, ravished from some
medieval church.&nbsp; The place seemed hidden away, being not
only concealed in the trees of the garden, but, on the side on
which I approached it, buried as high as the eaves by the rising
of the ground.&nbsp; About the walls of the garden there went a
line of well-grown elms and beeches, the first entirely bare, the
last still pretty well covered with red leaves, and the centre
was occupied with a thicket of laurel and holly, in which I could
see arches cut and paths winding.</p>
<p>I was now within hail of my friends, and not much the
better.&nbsp; The house appeared asleep; yet if I attempted to
wake any one, I had no guarantee it might not prove either the
aunt with the gold eyeglasses (whom I could only remember with
trembling), or some ass of a servant-maid who should burst out
screaming at sight of me.&nbsp; Higher up I could hear and see a
shepherd shouting to his dogs and striding on the rough sides of
the mountain, and it was clear I must get to cover without loss
of time.&nbsp; No doubt the holly thickets would have proved a
very suitable retreat, but there was mounted on the wall a sort
of signboard not uncommon in the country of Great Britain, and
very damping to the adventurous: <span class="smcap">Spring Guns
and Man-Traps</span> was the legend that it bore.&nbsp; I have
learned since that these advertisements, three times out of four,
were in the nature of Quaker guns on a disarmed battery, but I
had not learned it then, and even so, the odds would not have
been good enough.&nbsp; For a choice, I would a hundred times
sooner be returned to Edinburgh Castle and my corner in the
bastion, than to leave my foot in a steel trap or have to digest
the contents of an automatic blunderbuss.&nbsp; There was but one
chance left&mdash;that Ronald or Flora might be the first to come
abroad; and in order to profit by this chance if it occurred, I
got me on the cope of the wall in a place where it was screened
by the thick branches of a beech, and sat there waiting.</p>
<p>As the day wore on, the sun came very pleasantly out.&nbsp; I
had been awake all night, I had undergone the most violent
agitations of mind and body, and it is not so much to be wondered
at, as it was exceedingly unwise and foolhardy, that I should
have dropped into a doze.&nbsp; From this I awakened to the
characteristic sound of digging, looked down, and saw immediately
below me the back view of a gardener in a stable waistcoat.&nbsp;
Now he would appear steadily immersed in his business; anon, to
my more immediate terror, he would straighten his back, stretch
his arms, gaze about the otherwise deserted garden, and relish a
deep pinch of snuff.&nbsp; It was my first thought to drop from
the wall upon the other side.&nbsp; A glance sufficed to show me
that even the way by which I had come was now cut off, and the
field behind me already occupied by a couple of shepherds&rsquo;
assistants and a score or two of sheep.&nbsp; I have named the
talismans on which I habitually depend, but here was a
conjuncture in which both were wholly useless.&nbsp; The
copestone of a wall arrayed with broken bottles is no favourable
rostrum; and I might be as eloquent as Pitt, and as fascinating
as Richelieu, and neither the gardener nor the shepherd lads
would care a halfpenny.&nbsp; In short, there was no escape
possible from my absurd position: there I must continue to sit
until one or other of my neighbours should raise his eyes and
give the signal for my capture.</p>
<p>The part of the wall on which (for my sins) I was posted could
be scarce less than twelve feet high on the inside; the leaves of
the beech which made a fashion of sheltering me were already
partly fallen; and I was thus not only perilously exposed myself,
but enabled to command some part of the garden walks and (under
an evergreen arch) the front lawn and windows of the
cottage.&nbsp; For long nothing stirred except my friend with the
spade; then I heard the opening of a sash; and presently after
saw Miss Flora appear in a morning wrapper and come strolling
hitherward between the borders, pausing and visiting her
flowers&mdash;herself as fair.&nbsp; <i>There</i> was a friend;
<i>here</i>, immediately beneath me, an unknown
quantity&mdash;the gardener: how to communicate with the one and
not attract the notice of the other?&nbsp; To make a noise was
out of the question; I dared scarce to breathe.&nbsp; I held
myself ready to make a gesture as soon as she should look, and
she looked in every possible direction but the one.&nbsp; She was
interested in the vilest tuft of chickweed, she gazed at the
summit of the mountain, she came even immediately below me and
conversed on the most fastidious topics with the gardener; but to
the top of that wall she would not dedicate a glance!&nbsp; At
last she began to retrace her steps in the direction of the
cottage; whereupon, becoming quite desperate, I broke off a piece
of plaster, took a happy aim, and hit her with it in the nape of
the neck.&nbsp; She clapped her hand to the place, turned about,
looked on all sides for an explanation, and spying me (as indeed
I was parting the branches to make it the more easy), half
uttered and half swallowed down again a cry of surprise.</p>
<p>The infernal gardener was erect upon the instant.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your wull, miss?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>Her readiness amazed me.&nbsp; She had already turned and was
gazing in the opposite direction.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a
child among the artichokes,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Plagues of Egyp&rsquo;!&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> see
to them!&rsquo; cried the gardener truculently, and with a
hurried waddle disappeared among the evergreens.</p>
<p>That moment she turned, she came running towards me, her arms
stretched out, her face incarnadined for the one moment with
heavenly blushes, the next pale as death.&nbsp; &lsquo;Monsieur
de. Saint-Yves!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear young lady,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;this is the
damnedest liberty&mdash;I know it!&nbsp; But what else was I to
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have escaped?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you call this escape,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you cannot possibly stop there!&rsquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;And where am I
to go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She struck her hands together.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have it!&rsquo;
she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come down by the beech
trunk&mdash;you must leave no footprint in the
border&mdash;quickly, before Robie can get back!&nbsp; I am the
hen-wife here: I keep the key; you must go into the
hen-house&mdash;for the moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was by her side at once.&nbsp; Both cast a hasty glance at
the blank windows of the cottage and so much as was visible of
the garden alleys; it seemed there was none to observe us.&nbsp;
She caught me by the sleeve and ran.&nbsp; It was no time for
compliments; hurry breathed upon our necks; and I ran along with
her to the next corner of the garden, where a wired court and a
board hovel standing in a grove of trees advertised my place of
refuge.&nbsp; She thrust me in without a word; the bulk of the
fowls were at the same time emitted; and I found myself the next
moment locked in alone with half a dozen sitting hens.&nbsp; In
the twilight of the place all fixed their eyes on me severely,
and seemed to upbraid me with some crying impropriety.&nbsp;
Doubtless the hen has always a puritanic appearance, although (in
its own behaviour) I could never observe it to be more particular
than its neighbours.&nbsp; But conceive a British hen!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE HEN-HOUSE</h2>
<p>I was half an hour at least in the society of these
distressing bipeds, and alone with my own reflections and
necessities.&nbsp; I was in great pain of my flayed hands, and
had nothing to treat them with; I was hungry and thirsty, and had
nothing to eat or to drink; I was thoroughly tired, and there was
no place for me to sit.&nbsp; To be sure there was the floor, but
nothing could be imagined less inviting.</p>
<p>At the sound of approaching footsteps, my good-humour was
restored.&nbsp; The key rattled in the lock, and Master Ronald
entered, closed the door behind him, and leaned his back to
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, you know!&rsquo; he said, and shook a sullen
young head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it&rsquo;s a liberty,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s infernally awkward: my position is
infernally embarrassing,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and what do you think of
mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to pose him entirely, and he remained gazing upon
me with a convincing air of youth and innocence.&nbsp; I could
have laughed, but I was not so inhumane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am in your hands,&rsquo; said I, with a little
gesture.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must do with me what you think
right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes!&rsquo; he cried: &lsquo;if I knew!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it would be different if
you had received your commission.&nbsp; Properly speaking, you
are not yet a combatant; I have ceased to be one; and I think it
arguable that we are just in the position of one ordinary
gentleman to another, where friendship usually comes before the
law.&nbsp; Observe, I only say <i>arguable</i>.&nbsp; For
God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t think I wish to dictate an
opinion.&nbsp; These are the sort of nasty little businesses,
inseparable from war, which every gentleman must decide for
himself.&nbsp; If I were in your place&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, what would you do, then?&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my word, I do not know,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hesitate, as you are doing, I believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a
kinsman, and it is what <i>he</i> would think, that I am
thinking.&nbsp; It is General Graham of Lynedoch&mdash;Sir Thomas
Graham.&nbsp; I scarcely know him, but I believe I admire him
more than I do God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I admire him a good deal myself,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and have good reason to.&nbsp; I have fought with him,
been beaten, and run away.&nbsp; <i>Veni</i>, <i>victus sum</i>,
<i>evasi</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You were at
Barossa?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There and back, which many could not say,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was a pretty affair and a hot one, and the
Spaniards behaved abominably, as they usually did in a pitched
field; the Marshal Duke of Belluno made a fool of himself, and
not for the first time; and your friend Sir Thomas had the best
of it, so far as there was any best.&nbsp; He is a brave and
ready officer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, then, you will understand!&rsquo; said the
boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish to please Sir Thomas: what would he
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I can tell you a story,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;a
true one too, and about this very combat of Chiclana, or Barossa
as you call it.&nbsp; I was in the Eighth of the Line; we lost
the eagle of the First Battalion, more betoken, but it cost you
dear.&nbsp; Well, we had repulsed more charges than I care to
count, when your 87th Regiment came on at a foot&rsquo;s pace,
very slow but very steady; in front of them a mounted officer,
his hat in his hand, white-haired, and talking very quietly to
the battalions.&nbsp; Our Major, Vigo-Roussillon, set spurs to
his horse and galloped out to sabre him, but seeing him an old
man, very handsome, and as composed as if he were in a
coffee-house, lost heart and galloped back again.&nbsp; Only, you
see, they had been very close together for the moment, and looked
each other in the eyes.&nbsp; Soon after the Major was wounded,
taken prisoner, and carried into Cadiz.&nbsp; One fine day they
announced to him the visit of the General, Sir Thomas
Graham.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the General, taking
him by the hand, &ldquo;I think we were face to face upon the
field.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the white-haired officer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried the boy,&mdash;his eyes were
burning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and here is the point,&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sir Thomas fed the Major from his own table from that day,
and served him with six covers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is a beautiful&mdash;a beautiful story,&rsquo;
said Ronald.&nbsp; &lsquo;And yet somehow it is not the
same&mdash;is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I admit it freely,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>The boy stood awhile brooding.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I take my
risk of it,&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe it&rsquo;s
treason to my sovereign&mdash;I believe there is an infamous
punishment for such a crime&mdash;and yet I&rsquo;m hanged if I
can give you up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was as much moved as he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could almost beg you
to do otherwise,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was a brute to
come to you, a brute and a coward.&nbsp; You are a noble enemy;
you will make a noble soldier.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with rather a
happy idea of a compliment for this warlike youth, I stood up
straight and gave him the salute.</p>
<p>He was for a moment confused; his face flushed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, well, I must be getting you something to eat, but it
will not be for six,&rsquo; he added, with a smile: &lsquo;only
what we can get smuggled out.&nbsp; There is my aunt in the road,
you see,&rsquo; and he locked me in again with the indignant
hens.</p>
<p>I always smile when I recall that young fellow; and yet, if
the reader were to smile also, I should feel ashamed.&nbsp; If my
son shall be only like him when he comes to that age, it will be
a brave day for me and not a bad one for his country.</p>
<p>At the same time I cannot pretend that I was sorry when his
sister succeeded in his place.&nbsp; She brought me a few crusts
of bread and a jug of milk, which she had handsomely laced with
whisky after the Scottish manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so sorry,&rsquo; she said: &lsquo;I dared not
bring on anything more.&nbsp; We are so small a family, and my
aunt keeps such an eye upon the servants.&nbsp; I have put some
whisky in the milk&mdash;it is more wholesome so&mdash;and with
eggs you will be able to make something of a meal.&nbsp; How many
eggs will you be wanting to that milk? for I must be taking the
others to my aunt&mdash;that is my excuse for being here.&nbsp; I
should think three or four.&nbsp; Do you know how to beat them?
or shall I do it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Willing to detain her a while longer in the hen-house, I
displayed my bleeding palms; at which she cried aloud.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Miss Flora, you cannot make an omelette without
breaking eggs,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and it is no bagatelle to
escape from Edinburgh Castle.&nbsp; One of us, I think, was even
killed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you are as white as a rag, too,&rsquo; she
exclaimed, &lsquo;and can hardly stand!&nbsp; Here is my shawl,
sit down upon it here in the corner, and I will beat your
eggs.&nbsp; See, I have brought a fork too; I should have been a
good person to take care of Jacobites or Covenanters in old
days!&nbsp; You shall have more to eat this evening; Ronald is to
bring it you from town.&nbsp; We have money enough, although no
food that we can call our own.&nbsp; Ah, if Ronald and I kept
house, you should not be lying in this shed!&nbsp; He admires you
so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear friend,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for God&rsquo;s
sake do not embarrass me with more alms.&nbsp; I loved to receive
them from that hand, so long as they were needed; but they are so
no more, and whatever else I may lack&mdash;and I lack
everything&mdash;it is not money.&rsquo;&nbsp; I pulled out my
sheaf of notes and detached the top one: it was written for ten
pounds, and signed by that very famous individual, Abraham
Newlands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oblige me, as you would like me to oblige
your brother if the parts were reversed, and take this note for
the expenses.&nbsp; I shall need not only food, but
clothes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lay it on the ground,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
must not stop my beating.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not offended?&rsquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>She answered me by a look that was a reward in itself, and
seemed to imply the most heavenly offers for the future.&nbsp;
There was in it a shadow of reproach, and such warmth of
communicative cordiality as left me speechless.&nbsp; I watched
her instead till her hens&rsquo; milk was ready.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;taste that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I did so, and swore it was nectar.&nbsp; She collected her
eggs and crouched in front of me to watch me eat.&nbsp; There was
about this tall young lady at the moment an air of motherliness
delicious to behold.&nbsp; I am like the English general, and to
this day I still wonder at my moderation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What sort of clothes will you be wanting?&rsquo; said
she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The clothes of a gentleman,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Right or wrong, I think it is the part I am best qualified
to play.&nbsp; Mr. St. Ives (for that&rsquo;s to be my name upon
the journey) I conceive as rather a theatrical figure, and his
make-up should be to match.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet there is a difficulty,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you got coarse clothes the fit would hardly
matter.&nbsp; But the clothes of a fine gentleman&mdash;O, it is
absolutely necessary that these should fit!&nbsp; And above all,
with your&rsquo;&mdash;she paused a moment&mdash;&lsquo;to our
ideas somewhat noticeable manners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas for my poor manners!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But my dear friend Flora, these little noticeabilities are
just what mankind has to suffer under.&nbsp; Yourself, you see,
you&rsquo;re very noticeable even when you come in a crowd to
visit poor prisoners in the Castle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was afraid I should frighten my good angel visitant away,
and without the smallest breath of pause went on to add a few
directions as to stuffs and colours.</p>
<p>She opened big eyes upon me.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, Mr. St.
Ives!&rsquo; she cried&mdash;&lsquo;if that is to be your
name&mdash;I do not say they would not be becoming; but for a
journey, do you think they would be wise?&nbsp; I am
afraid&rsquo;&mdash;she gave a pretty break of
laughter&mdash;&lsquo;I am afraid they would be
daft-like!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and am I not daft?&rsquo; I asked her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do begin to think you are,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There it is, then!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
been long enough a figure of fun.&nbsp; Can you not feel with me
that perhaps the bitterest thing in this captivity has been the
clothes?&nbsp; Make me a captive&mdash;bind me with chains if you
like&mdash;but let me be still myself.&nbsp; You do not know what
it is to be a walking travesty&mdash;among foes,&rsquo; I added
bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, but you are too unjust!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You speak as though any one ever dreamed of laughing at
you.&nbsp; But no one did.&nbsp; We were all pained to the
heart.&nbsp; Even my aunt&mdash;though sometimes I do think she
was not quite in good taste&mdash;you should have seen her and
heard her at home!&nbsp; She took so much interest.&nbsp; Every
patch in your clothes made us sorry; it should have been a
sister&rsquo;s work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is what I never had&mdash;a sister,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But since you say that I did not make you
laugh&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Mr. St. Ives! never!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not for one moment.&nbsp; It was all too sad.&nbsp; To see
a gentleman&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the clothes of a harlequin, and begging?&rsquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To see a gentleman in distress, and nobly supporting
it,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do you not understand, my fair foe,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;that even if all were as you say&mdash;even if you had
thought my travesty were becoming&mdash;I should be only the more
anxious, for my sake, for my country&rsquo;s sake, and for the
sake of your kindness, that you should see him whom you have
helped as God meant him to be seen? that you should have
something to remember him by at least more characteristic than a
misfitting sulphur-yellow suit, and half a week&rsquo;s
beard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think a great deal too much of clothes,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not that kind of girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I am afraid I am that kind of man,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But do not think of me too harshly for
that.&nbsp; I talked just now of something to remember by.&nbsp;
I have many of them myself, of these beautiful reminders, of
these keepsakes, that I cannot be parted from until I lose memory
and life.&nbsp; Many of them are great things, many of them are
high virtues&mdash;charity, mercy, faith.&nbsp; But some of them
are trivial enough.&nbsp; Miss Flora, do you remember the day
that I first saw you, the day of the strong east wind?&nbsp; Miss
Flora, shall I tell you what you wore?&rsquo;</p>
<p>We had both risen to our feet, and she had her hand already on
the door to go.&nbsp; Perhaps this attitude emboldened me to
profit by the last seconds of our interview; and it certainly
rendered her escape the more easy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, you are too romantic!&rsquo; she said, laughing; and
with that my sun was blown out, my enchantress had fled away, and
I was again left alone in the twilight with the lady hens.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX&mdash;THREE IS COMPANY, AND FOUR NONE</h2>
<p>The rest of the day I slept in the corner of the hen-house
upon Flora&rsquo;s shawl.&nbsp; Nor did I awake until a light
shone suddenly in my eyes, and starting up with a gasp (for,
indeed, at the moment I dreamed I was still swinging from the
Castle battlements) I found Ronald bending over me with a
lantern.&nbsp; It appeared it was past midnight, that I had slept
about sixteen hours, and that Flora had returned her poultry to
the shed and I had heard her not.&nbsp; I could not but wonder if
she had stooped to look at me as I slept.&nbsp; The puritan hens
now slept irremediably; and being cheered with the promise of
supper I wished them an ironical good-night, and was lighted
across the garden and noiselessly admitted to a bedroom on the
ground floor of the cottage.&nbsp; There I found soap, water,
razors&mdash;offered me diffidently by my beardless
host&mdash;and an outfit of new clothes.&nbsp; To be shaved again
without depending on the barber of the gaol was a source of a
delicious, if a childish joy.&nbsp; My hair was sadly too long,
but I was none so unwise as to make an attempt on it
myself.&nbsp; And, indeed, I thought it did not wholly misbecome
me as it was, being by nature curly.&nbsp; The clothes were about
as good as I expected.&nbsp; The waistcoat was of toilenet, a
pretty piece, the trousers of fine kerseymere, and the coat sat
extraordinarily well.&nbsp; Altogether, when I beheld this
changeling in the glass, I kissed my hand to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;have you no
scent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God, no!&rsquo; cried Ronald.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do
you want with scent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Capital thing on a campaign,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I can do without.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was now led, with the same precautions against noise, into
the little bow-windowed dining-room of the cottage.&nbsp; The
shutters were up, the lamp guiltily turned low; the beautiful
Flora greeted me in a whisper; and when I was set down to table,
the pair proceeded to help me with precautions that might have
seemed excessive in the Ear of Dionysius.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She sleeps up there,&rsquo; observed the boy, pointing
to the ceiling; and the knowledge that I was so imminently near
to the resting-place of that gold eyeglass touched even myself
with some uneasiness.</p>
<p>Our excellent youth had imported from the city a meat pie, and
I was glad to find it flanked with a decanter of really admirable
wine of Oporto.&nbsp; While I ate, Ronald entertained me with the
news of the city, which had naturally rung all day with our
escape: troops and mounted messengers had followed each other
forth at all hours and in all directions; but according to the
last intelligence no recapture had been made.&nbsp; Opinion in
town was very favourable to us: our courage was applauded, and
many professed regret that our ultimate chance of escape should
be so small.&nbsp; The man who had fallen was one Sombref, a
peasant; he was one who slept in a different part of the Castle;
and I was thus assured that the whole of my former companions had
attained their liberty, and Shed A was untenanted.</p>
<p>From this we wandered insensibly into other topics.&nbsp; It
is impossible to exaggerate the pleasure I took to be thus
sitting at the same table with Flora, in the clothes of a
gentleman, at liberty and in the full possession of my spirits
and resources; of all of which I had need, because it was
necessary that I should support at the same time two opposite
characters, and at once play the cavalier and lively soldier for
the eyes of Ronald, and to the ears of Flora maintain the same
profound and sentimental note that I had already sounded.&nbsp;
Certainly there are days when all goes well with a man; when his
wit, his digestion, his mistress are in a conspiracy to spoil
him, and even the weather smiles upon his wishes.&nbsp; I will
only say of myself upon that evening that I surpassed my
expectations, and was privileged to delight my hosts.&nbsp;
Little by little they forgot their terrors and I my caution;
until at last we were brought back to earth by a catastrophe that
might very easily have been foreseen, but was not the less
astonishing to us when it occurred.</p>
<p>I had filled all the glasses.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a toast to
propose,&rsquo; I whispered, &lsquo;or rather three, but all so
inextricably interwoven that they will not bear dividing.&nbsp; I
wish first to drink to the health of a brave and therefore a
generous enemy.&nbsp; He found me disarmed, a fugitive and
helpless.&nbsp; Like the lion, he disdained so poor a triumph;
and when he might have vindicated an easy valour, he preferred to
make a friend.&nbsp; I wish that we should next drink to a fairer
and a more tender foe.&nbsp; She found me in prison; she cheered
me with a priceless sympathy; what she has done since, I know she
has done in mercy, and I only pray&mdash;I dare scarce
hope&mdash;her mercy may prove to have been merciful.&nbsp; And I
wish to conjoin with these, for the first, and perhaps the last
time, the health&mdash;and I fear I may already say the
memory&mdash;of one who has fought, not always without success,
against the soldiers of your nation; but who came here,
vanquished already, only to be vanquished again by the loyal hand
of the one, by the unforgettable eyes of the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is to be feared I may have lent at times a certain
resonancy to my voice; it is to be feared that Ronald, who was
none the better for his own hospitality, may have set down his
glass with something of a clang.&nbsp; Whatever may have been the
cause, at least, I had scarce finished my compliment before we
were aware of a thump upon the ceiling overhead.&nbsp; It was to
be thought some very solid body had descended to the floor from
the level (possibly) of a bed.&nbsp; I have never seen
consternation painted in more lively colours than on the faces of
my hosts.&nbsp; It was proposed to smuggle me forth into the
garden, or to conceal my form under a horsehair sofa which stood
against the wall.&nbsp; For the first expedient, as was now plain
by the approaching footsteps, there was no longer time; from the
second I recoiled with indignation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear creatures,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;let us die,
but do not let us be ridiculous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The words were still upon my lips when the door opened and my
friend of the gold eyeglass appeared, a memorable figure, on the
threshold.&nbsp; In one hand she bore a bedroom candlestick; in
the other, with the steadiness of a dragoon, a
horse-pistol.&nbsp; She was wound about in shawls which did not
wholly conceal the candid fabric of her nightdress, and
surmounted by a nightcap of portentous architecture.&nbsp; Thus
accoutred, she made her entrance; laid down the candle and
pistol, as no longer called for; looked about the room with a
silence more eloquent than oaths; and then, in a thrilling
voice&mdash;&lsquo;To whom have I the pleasure?&rsquo; she said,
addressing me with a ghost of a bow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam, I am charmed, I am sure,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The story is a little long; and our meeting, however
welcome, was for the moment entirely unexpected by myself.&nbsp;
I am sure&mdash;&rsquo; but here I found I was quite sure of
nothing, and tried again.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have the honour,&rsquo;
I began, and found I had the honour to be only exceedingly
confused.&nbsp; With that, I threw myself outright upon her
mercy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Madam, I must be more frank with you,&rsquo;
I resumed.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have already proved your charity and
compassion for the French prisoners, I am one of these; and if my
appearance be not too much changed, you may even yet recognise in
me that <i>Oddity</i> who had the good fortune more than once to
make you smile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still gazing upon me through her glass, she uttered an
uncompromising grunt; and then, turning to her
niece&mdash;&lsquo;Flora,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;how comes he
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The culprits poured out for a while an antiphony of
explanations, which died out at last in a miserable silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think at least you might have told your aunt,&rsquo;
she snorted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; I interposed, &lsquo;they were about to
do so.&nbsp; It is my fault if it be not done already.&nbsp; But
I made it my prayer that your slumbers might be respected, and
this necessary formula of my presentation should be delayed until
to-morrow in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old lady regarded me with undissembled incredulity, to
which I was able to find no better repartee than a profound and I
trust graceful reverence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;French prisoners are very well in their place,&rsquo;
she said, &lsquo;but I cannot see that their place is in my
private dining-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I hope it may be said
without offence, but (except the Castle of Edinburgh) I cannot
think upon the spot from which I would so readily be
absent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this, to my relief, I thought I could perceive a vestige of
a smile to steal upon that iron countenance and to be bitten
immediately in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if it is a fair question, what do they call
ye?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At your service, the Vicomte Anne de St.-Yves,&rsquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mosha the Viscount,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I am afraid
you do us plain people a great deal too much honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear lady,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;let us be serious
for a moment.&nbsp; What was I to do?&nbsp; Where was I to
go?&nbsp; And how can you be angry with these benevolent children
who took pity on one so unfortunate as myself?&nbsp; Your humble
servant is no such terrific adventurer that you should come out
against him with horse-pistol
and&rsquo;&mdash;smiling&mdash;&lsquo;bedroom candlesticks.&nbsp;
It is but a young gentleman in extreme distress, hunted upon
every side, and asking no more than to escape from his
pursuers.&nbsp; I know your character, I read it in your
face&rsquo;&mdash;the heart trembled in my body as I said these
daring words.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are unhappy English prisoners in
France at this day, perhaps at this hour.&nbsp; Perhaps at this
hour they kneel as I do; they take the hand of her who might
conceal and assist them; they press it to their lips as I
do&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, here!&rsquo; cried the old lady, breaking from my
solicitations.&nbsp; &lsquo;Behave yourself before folk!&nbsp;
Saw ever anyone the match of that?&nbsp; And on earth, my dears,
what are we to do with him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pack him off, my dear lady,&rsquo; said I: &lsquo;pack
off the impudent fellow double-quick!&nbsp; And if it may be, and
if your good heart allows it, help him a little on the way he has
to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s this pie?&rsquo; she cried
stridently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is this pie from,
Flora?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No answer was vouchsafed by my unfortunate and (I may say)
extinct accomplices.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that my port?&rsquo; she pursued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hough!&nbsp; Will somebody give me a glass of my port
wine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I made haste to serve her.</p>
<p>She looked at me over the rim with an extraordinary
expression.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope ye liked it?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is even a magnificent wine,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aweel, it was my father laid it down,&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;There were few knew more about port wine than
my father, God rest him!&rsquo;&nbsp; She settled herself in a
chair with an alarming air of resolution.&nbsp; &lsquo;And so
there is some particular direction that you wish to go in?&rsquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O,&rsquo; said I, following her example, &lsquo;I am by
no means such a vagrant as you suppose.&nbsp; I have good
friends, if I could get to them, for which all I want is to be
once clear of Scotland; and I have money for the
road.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I produced my bundle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;English bank-notes?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not very handy for Scotland.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
been some fool of an Englishman that&rsquo;s given you these,
I&rsquo;m thinking.&nbsp; How much is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I declare to heaven I never thought to count!&rsquo; I
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;But that is soon remedied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I counted out ten notes of ten pound each, all in the name
of Abraham Newlands, and five bills of country bankers for as
many guineas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One hundred and twenty six pound five,&rsquo; cried the
old lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you carry such a sum about you, and
have not so much as counted it!&nbsp; If you are not a thief, you
must allow you are very thief-like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet, madam, the money is legitimately mine,&rsquo;
said I.</p>
<p>She took one of the bills and held it up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
there any probability, now, that this could be traced?&rsquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None, I should suppose; and if it were, it would be no
matter,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;With your usual penetration,
you guessed right.&nbsp; An Englishman brought it me.&nbsp; It
reached me, through the hands of his English solicitor, from my
great-uncle, the Comte de K&eacute;roual de Saint-Yves, I believe
the richest <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can do no more than take your word for it,&rsquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I trust, madam, not less,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;at this rate the matter
may be feasible.&nbsp; I will cash one of these five-guinea
bills, less the exchange, and give you silver and Scots notes to
bear you as far as the border.&nbsp; Beyond that, Mosha the
Viscount, you will have to depend upon yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I could not but express a civil hesitation as to whether the
amount would suffice, in my case, for so long a journey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but you havenae heard me
out.&nbsp; For if you are not too fine a gentleman to travel with
a pair of drovers, I believe I have found the very thing, and the
Lord forgive me for a treasonable old wife!&nbsp; There are a
couple stopping up by with the shepherd-man at the farm;
to-morrow they will take the road for England, probably by
skriegh of day&mdash;and in my opinion you had best be travelling
with the stots,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake do not suppose me to be so
effeminate a character!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;An old
soldier of Napoleon is certainly beyond suspicion.&nbsp; But,
dear lady, to what end? and how is the society of these excellent
gentlemen supposed to help me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear sir,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you do not at all
understand your own predicament, and must just leave your matters
in the hands of those who do.&nbsp; I dare say you have never
even heard tell of the drove-roads or the drovers; and I am
certainly not going to sit up all night to explain it to
you.&nbsp; Suffice it, that it is me who is arranging this
affair&mdash;the more shame to me!&mdash;and that is the way ye
have to go.&nbsp; Ronald,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;away up-by
to the shepherds; rowst them out of their beds, and make it
perfectly distinct that Sim is not to leave till he has seen
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ronald was nothing loath to escape from his aunt&rsquo;s
neighbourhood, and left the room and the cottage with a silent
expedition that was more like flight than mere obedience.&nbsp;
Meanwhile the old lady turned to her niece.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I would like to know what we are to do with him the
night!&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ronald and I meant to put him in the hen-house,&rsquo;
said the encrimsoned Flora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I can tell you he is to go to no such a
place,&rsquo; replied the aunt.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hen-house,
indeed!&nbsp; If a guest he is to be, he shall sleep in no mortal
hen-house.&nbsp; Your room is the most fit, I think, if he will
consent to occupy it on so great a suddenty.&nbsp; And as for
you, Flora, you shall sleep with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I could not help admiring the prudence and tact of this old
dowager, and of course it was not for me to make
objections.&nbsp; Ere I well knew how, I was alone with a flat
candlestick, which is not the most sympathetic of companions, and
stood studying the snuff in a frame of mind between triumph and
chagrin.&nbsp; All had gone well with my flight: the masterful
lady who had arrogated to herself the arrangement of the details
gave me every confidence; and I saw myself already arriving at my
uncle&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; But, alas! it was another story with my
love affair.&nbsp; I had seen and spoken with her alone; I had
ventured boldly; I had been not ill received; I had seen her
change colour, had enjoyed the undissembled kindness of her eyes;
and now, in a moment, down comes upon the scene that apocalyptic
figure with the nightcap and the horse-pistol, and with the very
wind of her coming behold me separated from my love!&nbsp;
Gratitude and admiration contended in my breast with the extreme
of natural rancour.&nbsp; My appearance in her house at past
midnight had an air (I could not disguise it from myself) that
was insolent and underhand, and could not but minister to the
worst suspicions.&nbsp; And the old lady had taken it well.&nbsp;
Her generosity was no more to be called in question than her
courage, and I was afraid that her intelligence would be found to
match.&nbsp; Certainly, Miss Flora had to support some shrewd
looks, and certainly she had been troubled.&nbsp; I could see but
the one way before me: to profit by an excellent bed, to try to
sleep soon, to be stirring early, and to hope for some renewed
occasion in the morning.&nbsp; To have said so much and yet to
say no more, to go out into the world upon so half-hearted a
parting, was more than I could accept.</p>
<p>It is my belief that the benevolent fiend sat up all night to
baulk me.&nbsp; She was at my bedside with a candle long ere day,
roused me, laid out for me a damnable misfit of clothes, and bade
me pack my own (which were wholly unsuited to the journey) in a
bundle.&nbsp; Sore grudging, I arrayed myself in a suit of some
country fabric, as delicate as sackcloth and about as becoming as
a shroud; and, on coming forth, found the dragon had prepared for
me a hearty breakfast.&nbsp; She took the head of the table,
poured out the tea, and entertained me as I ate with a great deal
of good sense and a conspicuous lack of charm.&nbsp; How often
did I not regret the change!&mdash;how often compare her, and
condemn her in the comparison, with her charming niece!&nbsp; But
if my entertainer was not beautiful, she had certainly been busy
in my interest.&nbsp; Already she was in communication with my
destined fellow-travellers; and the device on which she had
struck appeared entirely suitable.&nbsp; I was a young Englishman
who had outrun the constable; warrants were out against me in
Scotland, and it had become needful I should pass the border
without loss of time, and privately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have given a very good account of you,&rsquo; said
she, &lsquo;which I hope you may justify.&nbsp; I told them there
was nothing against you beyond the fact that you were put to the
haw (if that is the right word) for debt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I pray God you have the expression incorrectly,
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not give myself out
for a person easily alarmed; but you must admit there is
something barbarous and mediaeval in the sound well qualified to
startle a poor foreigner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the name of a process in Scots Law, and need
alarm no honest man,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you are a
very idle-minded young gentleman; you must still have your joke,
I see: I only hope you will have no cause to regret
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I pray you not to suppose, because I speak lightly,
that I do not feel deeply,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
kindness has quite conquered me; I lay myself at your
disposition, I beg you to believe, with real tenderness; I pray
you to consider me from henceforth as the most devoted of your
friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;here comes your
devoted friend the drover.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking he will be
eager for the road; and I will not be easy myself till I see you
well off the premises, and the dishes washed, before my
servant-woman wakes.&nbsp; Praise God, we have gotten one that is
a treasure at the sleeping!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The morning was already beginning to be blue in the trees of
the garden, and to put to shame the candle by which I had
breakfasted.&nbsp; The lady rose from table, and I had no choice
but to follow her example.&nbsp; All the time I was beating my
brains for any means by which I should be able to get a word
apart with Flora, or find the time to write her a billet.&nbsp;
The windows had been open while I breakfasted, I suppose to
ventilate the room from any traces of my passage there; and,
Master Ronald appearing on the front lawn, my ogre leaned forth
to address him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ronald,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;wasn&rsquo;t that Sim
that went by the wall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I snatched my advantage.&nbsp; Right at her back there was
pen, ink, and paper laid out.&nbsp; I wrote: &lsquo;I love
you&rsquo;; and before I had time to write more, or so much as to
blot what I had written, I was again under the guns of the gold
eyeglasses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s time,&rsquo; she began; and then, as she
observed my occupation, &lsquo;Umph!&rsquo; she broke off.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ye have something to write?&rsquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some notes, madam,&rsquo; said I, bowing with
alacrity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Notes,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;or a note?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is doubtless some <i>finesse</i> of the English
language that I do not comprehend,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll contrive, however, to make my meaning very
plain to ye, Mosha le Viscount,&rsquo; she continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I suppose you desire to be considered a
gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you doubt it, madam?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I doubt very much, at least, whether you go to the
right way about it,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have come
here to me, I cannot very well say how; I think you will admit
you owe me some thanks, if it was only for the breakfast I made
ye.&nbsp; But what are you to me?&nbsp; A waif young man, not so
far to seek for looks and manners, with some English notes in
your pocket and a price upon your head.&nbsp; I am a lady; I have
been your hostess, with however little will; and I desire that
this random acquaintance of yours with my family will cease and
determine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I believe I must have coloured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Madam,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;the notes are of no importance; and your least
pleasure ought certainly to be my law.&nbsp; You have felt, and
you have been pleased to express, a doubt of me.&nbsp; I tear
them up.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which you may be sure I did thoroughly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good lad!&rsquo; said the dragon, and
immediately led the way to the front lawn.</p>
<p>The brother and sister were both waiting us here, and, as well
as I could make out in the imperfect light, bore every appearance
of having passed through a rather cruel experience.&nbsp; Ronald
seemed ashamed to so much as catch my eye in the presence of his
aunt, and was the picture of embarrassment.&nbsp; As for Flora,
she had scarce the time to cast me one look before the dragon
took her by the arm, and began to march across the garden in the
extreme first glimmer of the dawn without exchanging
speech.&nbsp; Ronald and I followed in equal silence.</p>
<p>There was a door in that same high wall on the top of which I
had sat perched no longer gone than yesterday morning.&nbsp; This
the old lady set open with a key; and on the other side we were
aware of a rough-looking, thick-set man, leaning with his arms
(through which was passed a formidable staff) on a dry-stone
dyke.&nbsp; Him the old lady immediately addressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sim,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;this is the young
gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sim replied with an inarticulate grumble of sound, and a
movement of one arm and his head, which did duty for a
salutation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Mr. St. Ives,&rsquo; said the old lady,
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s high time for you to be taking the road.&nbsp;
But first of all let me give the change of your five-guinea
bill.&nbsp; Here are four pounds of it in British Linen notes,
and the balance in small silver, less sixpence.&nbsp; Some charge
a shilling, I believe, but I have given you the benefit of the
doubt.&nbsp; See and guide it with all the sense that you
possess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here, Mr. St. Ives,&rsquo; said Flora, speaking for
the first time, &lsquo;is a plaid which you will find quite
necessary on so rough a journey.&nbsp; I hope you will take it
from the hands of a Scotch friend,&rsquo; she added, and her
voice trembled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Genuine holly: I cut it myself,&rsquo; said Ronald, and
gave me as good a cudgel as a man could wish for in a row.</p>
<p>The formality of these gifts, and the waiting figure of the
driver, told me loudly that I must be gone.&nbsp; I dropped on
one knee and bade farewell to the aunt, kissing her hand.&nbsp; I
did the like&mdash;but with how different a passion!&mdash;to her
niece; as for the boy, I took him to my arms and embraced him
with a cordiality that seemed to strike him speechless.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo; I said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall never forget my friends.&nbsp; Keep me sometimes
in memory.&nbsp; Farewell!&rsquo; With that I turned my back and
began to walk away; and had scarce done so, when I heard the door
in the high wall close behind me.&nbsp; Of course this was the
aunt&rsquo;s doing; and of course, if I know anything of human
character, she would not let me go without some tart
expressions.&nbsp; I declare, even if I had heard them, I should
not have minded in the least, for I was quite persuaded that,
whatever admirers I might be leaving behind me in Swanston
Cottage, the aunt was not the least sincere.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X&mdash;THE DROVERS</h2>
<p>It took me a little effort to come abreast of my new
companion; for though he walked with an ugly roll and no great
appearance of speed, he could cover the around at a good rate
when he wanted to.&nbsp; Each looked at the other: I with natural
curiosity, he with a great appearance of distaste.&nbsp; I have
heard since that his heart was entirely set against me; he had
seen me kneel to the ladies, and diagnosed me for a
&lsquo;gesterin&rsquo; eediot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, ye&rsquo;re for England, are ye?&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>I told him yes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Weel, there&rsquo;s waur places, I believe,&rsquo; was
his reply; and he relapsed into a silence which was not broken
during a quarter of an hour of steady walking.</p>
<p>This interval brought us to the foot of a bare green valley,
which wound upwards and backwards among the hills.&nbsp; A little
stream came down the midst and made a succession of clear pools;
near by the lowest of which I was aware of a drove of shaggy
cattle, and a man who seemed the very counterpart of Mr. Sim
making a breakfast upon bread and cheese.&nbsp; This second
drover (whose name proved to be Candlish) rose on our
approach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a mannie that&rsquo;s to gang through with
us,&rsquo; said Sim.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was the auld wife,
Gilchrist, wanted it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aweel, aweel,&rsquo; said the other; and presently,
remembering his manners, and looking on me with a solemn grin,
&lsquo;A fine day!&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>I agreed with him, and asked him how he did.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brawly,&rsquo; was the reply; and without further
civilities, the pair proceeded to get the cattle under way.&nbsp;
This, as well as almost all the herding, was the work of a pair
of comely and intelligent dogs, directed by Sim or Candlish in
little more than monosyllables.&nbsp; Presently we were ascending
the side of the mountain by a rude green track, whose presence I
had not hitherto observed.&nbsp; A continual sound of munching
and the crying of a great quantity of moor birds accompanied our
progress, which the deliberate pace and perennial appetite of the
cattle rendered wearisomely slow.&nbsp; In the midst my two
conductors marched in a contented silence that I could not but
admire.&nbsp; The more I looked at them, the more I was impressed
by their absurd resemblance to each other.&nbsp; They were
dressed in the same coarse homespun, carried similar sticks, were
equally begrimed about the nose with snuff, and each wound in an
identical plaid of what is called the shepherd&rsquo;s
tartan.&nbsp; In a back view they might be described as
indistinguishable; and even from the front they were much
alike.&nbsp; An incredible coincidence of humours augmented the
impression.&nbsp; Thrice and four times I attempted to pave the
way for some exchange of thought, sentiment, or&mdash;at the
least of it&mdash;human words.&nbsp; An <i>Ay</i> or an
<i>Nhm</i> was the sole return, and the topic died on the
hill-side without echo.&nbsp; I can never deny that I was
chagrined; and when, after a little more walking, Sim turned
towards me and offered me a ram&rsquo;s horn of snuff, with the
question &lsquo;Do ye use it?&rsquo; I answered, with some
animation, &lsquo;Faith, sir, I would use pepper to introduce a
little cordiality.&rsquo;&nbsp; But even this sally failed to
reach, or at least failed to soften, my companions.</p>
<p>At this rate we came to the summit of a ridge, and saw the
track descend in front of us abruptly into a desert vale, about a
league in length, and closed at the farther end by no less barren
hilltops.&nbsp; Upon this point of vantage Sim came to a halt,
took off his hat, and mopped his brow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Weel,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;here we&rsquo;re at the
top o&rsquo; Howden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The top o&rsquo; Howden, sure eneuch,&rsquo; said
Candlish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. St. Ivey, are ye dry?&rsquo; said the first.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, really,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is not this Satan
reproving sin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What ails ye, man?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m offerin&rsquo; ye a dram.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if it be anything to drink,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I
am as dry as my neighbours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Sim produced from the corner of his plaid a black
bottle, and we all drank and pledged each other.&nbsp; I found
these gentlemen followed upon such occasions an invariable
etiquette, which you may be certain I made haste to
imitate.&nbsp; Each wiped his mouth with the back of his left
hand, held up the bottle in his right, remarked with emphasis,
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to ye!&rsquo; and swallowed as much of the
spirit as his fancy prompted.&nbsp; This little ceremony, which
was the nearest thing to manners I could perceive in either of my
companions, was repeated at becoming intervals, generally after
an ascent.&nbsp; Occasionally we shared a mouthful of ewe-milk
cheese and an inglorious form of bread, which I understood (but
am far from engaging my honour on the point) to be called
&lsquo;shearer&rsquo;s bannock.&rsquo;&nbsp; And that may be said
to have concluded our whole active intercourse for the first
day.</p>
<p>I had the more occasion to remark the extraordinarily desolate
nature of that country, through which the drove road continued,
hour after hour and even day after day, to wind.&nbsp; A
continual succession of insignificant shaggy hills, divided by
the course of ten thousand brooks, through which we had to wade,
or by the side of which we encamped at night; infinite
perspectives of heather, infinite quantities of moorfowl; here
and there, by a stream side, small and pretty clumps of willows
or the silver birch; here and there, the ruins of ancient and
inconsiderable fortresses&mdash;made the unchanging characters of
the scene.&nbsp; Occasionally, but only in the distance, we could
perceive the smoke of a small town or of an isolated farmhouse or
cottage on the moors; more often, a flock of sheep and its
attendant shepherd, or a rude field of agriculture perhaps not
yet harvested.&nbsp; With these alleviations, we might almost be
said to pass through an unbroken desert&mdash;sure, one of the
most impoverished in Europe; and when I recalled to mind that we
were yet but a few leagues from the chief city (where the law
courts sat every day with a press of business, soldiers
garrisoned the castle, and men of admitted parts were carrying on
the practice of letters and the investigations of science), it
gave me a singular view of that poor, barren, and yet illustrious
country through which I travelled.&nbsp; Still more, perhaps, did
it commend the wisdom of Miss Gilchrist in sending me with these
uncouth companions and by this unfrequented path.</p>
<p>My itinerary is by no means clear to me; the names and
distances I never clearly knew, and have now wholly forgotten;
and this is the more to be regretted as there is no doubt that,
in the course of those days, I must have passed and camped among
sites which have been rendered illustrious by the pen of Walter
Scott.&nbsp; Nay, more, I am of opinion that I was still more
favoured by fortune, and have actually met and spoken with that
inimitable author.&nbsp; Our encounter was of a tall, stoutish,
elderly gentleman, a little grizzled, and of a rugged but
cheerful and engaging countenance.&nbsp; He sat on a hill pony,
wrapped in a plaid over his green coat, and was accompanied by a
horse-woman, his daughter, a young lady of the most charming
appearance.&nbsp; They overtook us on a stretch of heath, reined
up as they came alongside, and accompanied us for perhaps a
quarter of an hour before they galloped off again across the
hillsides to our left.&nbsp; Great was my amazement to find the
unconquerable Mr. Sim thaw immediately on the accost of this
strange gentleman, who hailed him with a ready familiarity,
proceeded at once to discuss with him the trade of droving and
the prices of cattle, and did not disdain to take a pinch from
the inevitable ram&rsquo;s horn.&nbsp; Presently I was aware that
the stranger&rsquo;s eye was directed on myself; and there ensued
a conversation, some of which I could not help overhearing at the
time, and the rest have pieced together more or less plausibly
from the report of Sim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely that must be an <i>amateur drover</i> ye have
gotten there?&rsquo; the gentleman seems to have asked.</p>
<p>Sim replied, I was a young gentleman that had a reason of his
own to travel privately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, ye must tell me nothing of that.&nbsp; I am
in the law, you know, and <i>tace</i> is the Latin for a
candle,&rsquo; answered the gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I hope
it&rsquo;s nothing bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sim told him it was no more than debt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Lord, if that be all!&rsquo; cried the gentleman;
and turning to myself, &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;I understand you are taking a tramp through our forest
here for the pleasure of the thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, yes, sir,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and I must say I
am very well entertained.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I envy you,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have jogged
many miles of it myself when I was younger.&nbsp; My youth lies
buried about here under every heather-bush, like the soul of the
licentiate Lucius.&nbsp; But you should have a guide.&nbsp; The
pleasure of this country is much in the legends, which grow as
plentiful as blackberries.&rsquo;&nbsp; And directing my
attention to a little fragment of a broken wall no greater than a
tombstone, he told me for an example a story of its earlier
inhabitants.&nbsp; Years after it chanced that I was one day
diverting myself with a Waverley Novel, when what should I come
upon but the identical narrative of my green-coated gentleman
upon the moors!&nbsp; In a moment the scene, the tones of his
voice, his northern accent, and the very aspect of the earth and
sky and temperature of the weather, flashed back into my mind
with the reality of dreams.&nbsp; The unknown in the green-coat
had been the Great Unknown!&nbsp; I had met Scott; I had heard a
story from his lips; I should have been able to write, to claim
acquaintance, to tell him that his legend still tingled in my
ears.&nbsp; But the discovery came too late, and the great man
had already succumbed under the load of his honours and
misfortunes.</p>
<p>Presently, after giving us a cigar apiece, Scott bade us
farewell and disappeared with his daughter over the hills.&nbsp;
And when I applied to Sim for information, his answer of
&lsquo;The Shirra, man!&nbsp; A&rsquo;body kens the
Shirra!&rsquo; told me, unfortunately, nothing.</p>
<p>A more considerable adventure falls to be related.&nbsp; We
were now near the border.&nbsp; We had travelled for long upon
the track beaten and browsed by a million herds, our
predecessors, and had seen no vestige of that traffic which had
created it.&nbsp; It was early in the morning when we at last
perceived, drawing near to the drove road, but still at a
distance of about half a league, a second caravan, similar to but
larger than our own.&nbsp; The liveliest excitement was at once
exhibited by both my comrades.&nbsp; They climbed hillocks, they
studied the approaching drove from under their hand, they
consulted each other with an appearance of alarm that seemed to
me extraordinary.&nbsp; I had learned by this time that their
stand-off manners implied, at least, no active enmity; and I made
bold to ask them what was wrong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bad yins,&rsquo; was Sim&rsquo;s emphatic answer.</p>
<p>All day the dogs were kept unsparingly on the alert, and the
drove pushed forward at a very unusual and seemingly unwelcome
speed.&nbsp; All day Sim and Candlish, with a more than ordinary
expenditure both of snuff and of words, continued to debate the
position.&nbsp; It seems that they had recognised two of our
neighbours on the road&mdash;one Faa, and another by the name of
Gillies.&nbsp; Whether there was an old feud between them still
unsettled I could never learn; but Sim and Candlish were prepared
for every degree of fraud or violence at their hands.&nbsp;
Candlish repeatedly congratulated himself on having left
&lsquo;the watch at home with the mistress&rsquo;; and Sim
perpetually brandished his cudgel, and cursed his ill-fortune
that it should be sprung.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I willna care a damn to gie the daashed scoon&rsquo;rel
a fair clout wi&rsquo; it,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
daashed thing micht come sindry in ma hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;suppose they do
come on, I think we can give a very good account of
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I made my piece of holly, Ronald&rsquo;s
gift, the value of which I now appreciated, sing about my
head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, man?&nbsp; Are ye stench?&rsquo; inquired Sim, with
a gleam of approval in his wooden countenance.</p>
<p>The same evening, somewhat wearied with our day-long
expedition, we encamped on a little verdant mound, from the midst
of which there welled a spring of clear water scarce great enough
to wash the hands in.&nbsp; We had made our meal and lain down,
but were not yet asleep, when a growl from one of the collies set
us on the alert.&nbsp; All three sat up, and on a second impulse
all lay down again, but now with our cudgels ready.&nbsp; A man
must be an alien and an outlaw, an old soldier and a young man in
the bargain, to take adventure easily.&nbsp; With no idea as to
the rights of the quarrel or the probable consequences of the
encounter, I was as ready to take part with my two drovers, as
ever to fall in line on the morning of a battle.&nbsp; Presently
there leaped three men out of the heather; we had scarce time to
get to our feet before we were assailed; and in a moment each one
of us was engaged with an adversary whom the deepening twilight
scarce permitted him to see.&nbsp; How the battle sped in other
quarters I am in no position to describe.&nbsp; The rogue that
fell to my share was exceedingly agile and expert with his
weapon; had and held me at a disadvantage from the first assault;
forced me to give ground continually, and at last, in mere
self-defence, to let him have the point.&nbsp; It struck him in
the throat, and he went down like a ninepin and moved no
more.</p>
<p>It seemed this was the signal for the engagement to be
discontinued.&nbsp; The other combatants separated at once; our
foes were suffered, without molestation, to lift up and bear away
their fallen comrade; so that I perceived this sort of war to be
not wholly without laws of chivalry, and perhaps rather to
partake of the character of a tournament than of a battle
<i>&agrave; outrance</i>.&nbsp; There was no doubt, at least,
that I was supposed to have pushed the affair too
seriously.&nbsp; Our friends the enemy removed their wounded
companion with undisguised consternation; and they were no sooner
over the top of the brae, than Sim and Candlish roused up their
wearied drove and set forth on a night march.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking Faa&rsquo;s unco bad,&rsquo; said
the one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;he lookit dooms
gash.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did that,&rsquo; said the first.</p>
<p>And their weary silence fell upon them again.</p>
<p>Presently Sim turned to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re unco
ready with the stick,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too ready, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am afraid Mr. Faa (if that be his name) has got his
gruel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Weel, I wouldnae wonder,&rsquo; replied Sim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is likely to happen?&rsquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aweel,&rsquo; said Sim, snuffing profoundly, &lsquo;if
I were to offer an opeenion, it would not be conscientious.&nbsp;
For the plain fac&rsquo; is, Mr. St. Ivy, that I div not
ken.&nbsp; We have had crackit heids&mdash;and rowth of
them&mdash;ere now; and we have had a broken leg or maybe twa;
and the like of that we drover bodies make a kind of a practice
like to keep among oursel&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But a corp we have none
of us ever had to deal with, and I could set nae leemit to what
Gillies micht consider proper in the affair.&nbsp; Forbye that,
he would be in raither a hobble himsel&rsquo;, if he was to gang
hame wantin&rsquo; Faa.&nbsp; Folk are awfu&rsquo; throng with
their questions, and parteecularly when they&rsquo;re no
wantit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a fac&rsquo;,&rsquo; said Candlish.</p>
<p>I considered this prospect ruefully; and then making the best
of it, &lsquo;Upon all which accounts,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the
best will be to get across the border and there separate.&nbsp;
If you are troubled, you can very truly put the blame upon your
late companion; and if I am pursued, I must just try to keep out
of the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. St. Ivy,&rsquo; said Sim, with something resembling
enthusiasm, &lsquo;no&rsquo; a word mair!&nbsp; I have met in
wi&rsquo; mony kinds o&rsquo; gentry ere now; I hae seen o&rsquo;
them that was the tae thing, and I hae seen o&rsquo; them that
was the tither; but the wale of a gentleman like you I have no
sae very frequently seen the bate of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our night march was accordingly pursued with unremitting
diligence.&nbsp; The stars paled, the east whitened, and we were
still, both dogs and men, toiling after the wearied cattle.&nbsp;
Again and again Sim and Candlish lamented the necessity: it was
&lsquo;fair ruin on the bestial,&rsquo; they declared; but the
thought of a judge and a scaffold hunted them ever forward.&nbsp;
I myself was not so much to be pitied.&nbsp; All that night, and
during the whole of the little that remained before us of our
conjunct journey, I enjoyed a new pleasure, the reward of my
prowess, in the now loosened tongue of Mr. Sim.&nbsp; Candlish
was still obdurately taciturn: it was the man&rsquo;s nature; but
Sim, having finally appraised and approved me, displayed without
reticence a rather garrulous habit of mind and a pretty talent
for narration.&nbsp; The pair were old and close companions,
co-existing in these endless moors in a brotherhood of silence
such as I have heard attributed to the trappers of the
west.&nbsp; It seems absurd to mention love in connection with so
ugly and snuffy a couple; at least, their trust was absolute; and
they entertained a surprising admiration for each other&rsquo;s
qualities; Candlish exclaiming that Sim was &lsquo;grand
company!&rsquo; and Sim frequently assuring me in an aside that
for &lsquo;a rale, auld, stench bitch, there was nae the bate of
Candlish in braid Scotland.&rsquo;&nbsp; The two dogs appeared to
be entirely included in this family compact, and I remarked that
their exploits and traits of character were constantly and
minutely observed by the two masters.&nbsp; Dog stories
particularly abounded with them; and not only the dogs of the
present but those of the past contributed their quota.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But that was naething,&rsquo; Sim would begin:
&lsquo;there was a herd in Manar, they ca&rsquo;d him
Tweedie&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll mind Tweedie,
Can&rsquo;lish?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Fine, that!&rsquo; said
Candlish.&nbsp; &lsquo;Aweel, Tweedie had a
dog&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; The story I have forgotten; I dare say it
was dull, and I suspect it was not true; but indeed, my travels
with the drove rendered me indulgent, and perhaps even credulous,
in the matter of dog stories.&nbsp; Beautiful, indefatigable
beings! as I saw them at the end of a long day&rsquo;s journey
frisking, barking, bounding, striking attitudes, slanting a bushy
tail, manifestly playing to the spectator&rsquo;s eye, manifestly
rejoicing in their grace and beauty&mdash;and turned to observe
Sim and Candlish unornamentally plodding in the rear with the
plaids about their bowed shoulders and the drop at their snuffy
nose&mdash;I thought I would rather claim kinship with the dogs
than with the men!&nbsp; My sympathy was unreturned; in their
eyes I was a creature light as air; and they would scarce spare
me the time for a perfunctory caress or perhaps a hasty lap of
the wet tongue, ere they were back again in sedulous attendance
on those dingy deities, their masters&mdash;and their masters, as
like as not, damning their stupidity.</p>
<p>Altogether the last hours of our tramp were infinitely the
most agreeable to me, and I believe to all of us; and by the time
we came to separate, there had grown up a certain familiarity and
mutual esteem that made the parting harder.&nbsp; It took place
about four of the afternoon on a bare hillside from which I could
see the ribbon of the great north road, henceforth to be my
conductor.&nbsp; I asked what was to pay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naething,&rsquo; replied Sim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What in the name of folly is this?&rsquo; I
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have led me, you have fed me, you
have filled me full of whisky, and now you will take
nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye see we indentit for that,&rsquo; replied Sim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;Indented?&rsquo; I repeated; &lsquo;what does the
man mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. St. Ivy,&rsquo; said Sim, &lsquo;this is a maitter
entirely between Candlish and me and the auld wife,
Gilchrist.&nbsp; You had naething to say to it; weel, ye can have
naething to do with it, then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good man,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I can allow myself
to be placed in no such ridiculous position.&nbsp; Mrs. Gilchrist
is nothing to me, and I refuse to be her debtor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dinna exac&rsquo;ly see what way ye&rsquo;re gaun to
help it,&rsquo; observed my drover.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By paying you here and now,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s aye twa to a bargain, Mr. St.
Ives,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean that you will not take it?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There or thereabout,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Forbye, that it would set ye a heap better to keep your
siller for them you awe it to.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re young, Mr. St.
Ivy, and thoughtless; but it&rsquo;s my belief that, wi&rsquo;
care and circumspection, ye may yet do credit to
yoursel&rsquo;.&nbsp; But just you bear this in mind: that him
that <i>awes</i> siller should never <i>gie</i>
siller.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, what was there to say?&nbsp; I accepted his rebuke, and
bidding the pair farewell, set off alone upon my southward
way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. St. Ivy,&rsquo; was the last word of Sim, &lsquo;I
was never muckle ta&rsquo;en up in Englishry; but I think that I
really ought to say that ye seem to me to have the makings of
quite a decent lad.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE GREAT NORTH ROAD</h2>
<p>It chanced that as I went down the hill these last words of my
friend the drover echoed not unfruitfully in my head.&nbsp; I had
never told these men the least particulars as to my race or
fortune, as it was a part, and the best part, of their civility
to ask no questions: yet they had dubbed me without hesitation
English.&nbsp; Some strangeness in the accent they had doubtless
thus explained.&nbsp; And it occurred to me, that if I could pass
in Scotland for an Englishman, I might be able to reverse the
process and pass in England for a Scot.&nbsp; I thought, if I was
pushed to it, I could make a struggle to imitate the brogue;
after my experience with Candlish and Sim, I had a rich provision
of outlandish words at my command; and I felt I could tell the
tale of Tweedie&rsquo;s dog so as to deceive a native.&nbsp; At
the same time, I was afraid my name of St. Ives was scarcely
suitable; till I remembered there was a town so called in the
province of Cornwall, thought I might yet be glad to claim it for
my place of origin, and decided for a Cornish family and a Scots
education.&nbsp; For a trade, as I was equally ignorant of all,
and as the most innocent might at any moment be the means of my
exposure, it was best to pretend to none.&nbsp; And I dubbed
myself a young gentleman of a sufficient fortune and an idle,
curious habit of mind, rambling the country at my own charges, in
quest of health, information, and merry adventures.</p>
<p>At Newcastle, which was the first town I reached, I completed
my preparations for the part, before going to the inn, by the
purchase of a knapsack and a pair of leathern gaiters.&nbsp; My
plaid I continued to wear from sentiment.&nbsp; It was warm,
useful to sleep in if I were again benighted, and I had
discovered it to be not unbecoming for a man of gallant
carriage.&nbsp; Thus equipped, I supported my character of the
light-hearted pedestrian not amiss.&nbsp; Surprise was indeed
expressed that I should have selected such a season of the year;
but I pleaded some delays of business, and smilingly claimed to
be an eccentric.&nbsp; The devil was in it, I would say, if any
season of the year was not good enough for me; I was not made of
sugar, I was no mollycoddle to be afraid of an ill-aired bed or a
sprinkle of snow; and I would knock upon the table with my fist
and call for t&rsquo;other bottle, like the noisy and
free-hearted young gentleman I was.&nbsp; It was my policy (if I
may so express myself) to talk much and say little.&nbsp; At the
inn tables, the country, the state of the roads, the business
interest of those who sat down with me, and the course of public
events, afforded me a considerable field in which I might
discourse at large and still communicate no information about
myself.&nbsp; There was no one with less air of reticence; I
plunged into my company up to the neck; and I had a long
cock-and-bull story of an aunt of mine which must have convinced
the most suspicious of my innocence.&nbsp; &lsquo;What!&rsquo;
they would have said, &lsquo;that young ass to be concealing
anything!&nbsp; Why, he has deafened me with an aunt of his until
my head aches.&nbsp; He only wants you should give him a line,
and he would tell you his whole descent from Adam downward, and
his whole private fortune to the last shilling.&rsquo; A
responsible solid fellow was even so much moved by pity for my
inexperience as to give me a word or two of good advice: that I
was but a young man after all&mdash;I had at this time a
deceptive air of youth that made me easily pass for
one-and-twenty, and was, in the circumstances, worth a
fortune&mdash;that the company at inns was very mingled, that I
should do well to be more careful, and the like; to all which I
made answer that I meant no harm myself and expected none from
others, or the devil was in it.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are one of those
d---d prudent fellows that I could never abide with,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are the kind of man that has a long
head.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all the world, my dear sir: the
long-heads and the short-horns!&nbsp; Now, I am a
short-horn.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I doubt,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;that you will not go very far without getting
sheared.&rsquo;&nbsp; I offered to bet with him on that, and he
made off, shaking his head.</p>
<p>But my particular delight was to enlarge on politics and the
war.&nbsp; None damned the French like me; none was more bitter
against the Americans.&nbsp; And when the north-bound mail
arrived, crowned with holly, and the coachman and guard hoarse
with shouting victory, I went even so far as to entertain the
company to a bowl of punch, which I compounded myself with no
illiberal hand, and doled out to such sentiments as the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our glorious victory on the Nivelle&rsquo;!&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lord Wellington, God bless him! and may victory ever
attend upon his arms!&rsquo; and, &lsquo;Soult, poor devil! and
may he catch it again to the same tune!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Never was oratory more applauded to the echo&mdash;never any
one was more of the popular man than I.&nbsp; I promise you, we
made a night of it.&nbsp; Some of the company supported each
other, with the assistance of boots, to their respective
bedchambers, while the rest slept on the field of glory where we
had left them; and at the breakfast table the next morning there
was an extraordinary assemblage of red eyes and shaking
fists.&nbsp; I observed patriotism to burn much lower by
daylight.&nbsp; Let no one blame me for insensibility to the
reverses of France!&nbsp; God knows how my heart raged.&nbsp; How
I longed to fall on that herd of swine and knock their heads
together in the moment of their revelry!&nbsp; But you are to
consider my own situation and its necessities; also a certain
lightheartedness, eminently Gallic, which forms a leading trait
in my character, and leads me to throw myself into new
circumstances with the spirit of a schoolboy.&nbsp; It is
possible that I sometimes allowed this impish humour to carry me
further than good taste approves: and I was certainly punished
for it once.</p>
<p>This was in the episcopal city of Durham.&nbsp; We sat down, a
considerable company, to dinner, most of us fine old vatted
English tories of that class which is often so enthusiastic as to
be inarticulate.&nbsp; I took and held the lead from the
beginning; and, the talk having turned on the French in the
Peninsula, I gave them authentic details (on the authority of a
cousin of mine, an ensign) of certain cannibal orgies in Galicia,
in which no less a person than General Caffarelli had taken a
part.&nbsp; I always disliked that commander, who once ordered me
under arrest for insubordination; and it is possible that a spice
of vengeance added to the rigour of my picture.&nbsp; I have
forgotten the details; no doubt they were high-coloured.&nbsp; No
doubt I rejoiced to fool these jolter-heads; and no doubt the
sense of security that I drank from their dull, gasping faces
encouraged me to proceed extremely far.&nbsp; And for my sins,
there was one silent little man at table who took my story at the
true value.&nbsp; It was from no sense of humour, to which he was
quite dead.&nbsp; It was from no particular intelligence, for he
had not any.&nbsp; The bond of sympathy, of all things in the
world, had rendered him clairvoyant.</p>
<p>Dinner was no sooner done than I strolled forth into the
streets with some design of viewing the cathedral; and the little
man was silently at my heels.&nbsp; A few doors from the inn, in
a dark place of the street, I was aware of a touch on my arm,
turned suddenly, and found him looking up at me with eyes
pathetically bright.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir; but that story of yours was
particularly rich.&nbsp; He&mdash;he!&nbsp; Particularly
racy,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I tell you, sir, I took you
wholly!&nbsp; I <i>smoked</i> you!&nbsp; I believe you and I,
sir, if we had a chance to talk, would find we had a good many
opinions in common.&nbsp; Here is the &ldquo;Blue Bell,&rdquo; a
very comfortable place.&nbsp; They draw good ale, sir.&nbsp;
Would you be so condescending as to share a pot with
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was something so ambiguous and secret in the little
man&rsquo;s perpetual signalling, that I confess my curiosity was
much aroused.&nbsp; Blaming myself, even as I did so, for the
indiscretion, I embraced his proposal, and we were soon face to
face over a tankard of mulled ale.&nbsp; He lowered his voice to
the least attenuation of a whisper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is to the Great
Man.&nbsp; I think you take me?&nbsp; No?&rsquo;&nbsp; He leaned
forward till our noses touched.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here is to the
Emperor!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>I was extremely embarrassed, and, in spite of the
creature&rsquo;s innocent appearance, more than half
alarmed.&nbsp; I thought him too ingenious, and, indeed, too
daring for a spy.&nbsp; Yet if he were honest he must be a man of
extraordinary indiscretion, and therefore very unfit to be
encouraged by an escaped prisoner.&nbsp; I took a half course,
accordingly&mdash;accepted his toast in silence, and drank it
without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>He proceeded to abound in the praises of Napoleon, such as I
had never heard in France, or at least only on the lips of
officials paid to offer them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this Caffarelli, now,&rsquo; he pursued: &lsquo;he
is a splendid fellow, too, is he not?&nbsp; I have not heard
vastly much of him myself.&nbsp; No details, sir&mdash;no
details!&nbsp; We labour under huge difficulties here as to
unbiassed information.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe I have heard the same complaint in other
countries,&rsquo; I could not help remarking.&nbsp; &lsquo;But as
to Caffarelli, he is neither lame nor blind, he has two legs and
a nose in the middle of his face.&nbsp; And I care as much about
him as you care for the dead body of Mr. Perceval!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He studied me with glowing eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot deceive me!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You have served under him.&nbsp; You are a
Frenchman!&nbsp; I hold by the hand, at last, one of that noble
race, the pioneers of the glorious principles of liberty and
brotherhood.&nbsp; Hush!&nbsp; No, it is all right.&nbsp; I
thought there had been somebody at the door.&nbsp; In this
wretched, enslaved country we dare not even call our souls our
own.&nbsp; The spy and the hangman, sir&mdash;the spy and the
hangman!&nbsp; And yet there is a candle burning, too.&nbsp; The
good leaven is working, sir&mdash;working underneath.&nbsp; Even
in this town there are a few brave spirits, who meet every
Wednesday.&nbsp; You must stay over a day or so, and join
us.&nbsp; We do not use this house.&nbsp; Another, and a
quieter.&nbsp; They draw fine ale, however&mdash;fair, mild
ale.&nbsp; You will find yourself among friends, among
brothers.&nbsp; You will hear some very daring sentiments
expressed!&rsquo; he cried, expanding his small chest.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Monarchy, Christianity&mdash;all the trappings of a
bloated past&mdash;the Free Confraternity of Durham and Tyneside
deride.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here was a devil of a prospect for a gentleman whose whole
design was to avoid observation!&nbsp; The Free Confraternity had
no charms for me; daring sentiments were no part of my baggage;
and I tried, instead, a little cold water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to forget, sir, that my Emperor has
re-established Christianity,&rsquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, sir, but that was policy!&rsquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;You do not understand Napoleon.&nbsp; I
have followed his whole career.&nbsp; I can explain his policy
from first to last.&nbsp; Now for instance in the Peninsula, on
which you were so very amusing, if you will come to a
friend&rsquo;s house who has a map of Spain, I can make the whole
course of the war quite clear to you, I venture to say, in half
an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was intolerable.&nbsp; Of the two extremes, I found I
preferred the British tory; and, making an appointment for the
morrow, I pleaded sudden headache, escaped to the inn, packed my
knapsack, and fled, about nine at night, from this accursed
neighbourhood.&nbsp; It was cold, starry, and clear, and the road
dry, with a touch of frost.&nbsp; For all that, I had not the
smallest intention to make a long stage of it; and about ten
o&rsquo;clock, spying on the right-hand side of the way the
lighted windows of an alehouse, I determined to bait there for
the night.</p>
<p>It was against my principle, which was to frequent only the
dearest inns; and the misadventure that befell me was sufficient
to make me more particular in the future.&nbsp; A large company
was assembled in the parlour, which was heavy with clouds of
tobacco smoke, and brightly lighted up by a roaring fire of
coal.&nbsp; Hard by the chimney stood a vacant chair in what I
thought an enviable situation, whether for warmth or the pleasure
of society; and I was about to take it, when the nearest of the
company stopped me with his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg thy pardon, sir,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;but that
there chair belongs to a British soldier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A chorus of voices enforced and explained.&nbsp; It was one of
Lord Wellington&rsquo;s heroes.&nbsp; He had been wounded under
Rowland Hill.&nbsp; He was Colbourne&rsquo;s right-hand
man.&nbsp; In short, this favoured individual appeared to have
served with every separate corps, and under every individual
general in the Peninsula.&nbsp; Of course I apologised.&nbsp; I
had not known.&nbsp; The devil was in it if a soldier had not a
right to the best in England.&nbsp; And with that sentiment,
which was loudly applauded, I found a corner of a bench, and
awaited, with some hopes of entertainment, the return of the
hero.&nbsp; He proved, of course, to be a private soldier.&nbsp;
I say of course, because no officer could possibly enjoy such
heights of popularity.&nbsp; He had been wounded before San
Sebastian, and still wore his arm in a sling.&nbsp; What was a
great deal worse for him, every member of the company had been
plying him with drink.&nbsp; His honest yokel&rsquo;s countenance
blazed as if with fever, his eyes were glazed and looked the two
ways, and his feet stumbled as, amidst a murmur of applause, he
returned to the midst of his admirers.</p>
<p>Two minutes afterwards I was again posting in the dark along
the highway; to explain which sudden movement of retreat I must
trouble the reader with a reminiscence of my services.</p>
<p>I lay one night with the out-pickets in Castile.&nbsp; We were
in close touch with the enemy; the usual orders had been issued
against smoking, fires, and talk, and both armies lay as quiet as
mice, when I saw the English sentinel opposite making a signal by
holding up his musket.&nbsp; I repeated it, and we both crept
together in the dry bed of a stream, which made the demarcation
of the armies.&nbsp; It was wine he wanted, of which we had a
good provision, and the English had quite run out.&nbsp; He gave
me the money, and I, as was the custom, left him my firelock in
pledge, and set off for the canteen.&nbsp; When I returned with a
skin of wine, behold, it had pleased some uneasy devil of an
English officer to withdraw the outposts!&nbsp; Here was a
situation with a vengeance, and I looked for nothing but ridicule
in the present and punishment in the future.&nbsp; Doubtless our
officers winked pretty hard at this interchange of courtesies,
but doubtless it would be impossible to wink at so gross a fault,
or rather so pitiable a misadventure as mine; and you are to
conceive me wandering in the plains of Castile, benighted,
charged with a wine-skin for which I had no use, and with no
knowledge whatever of the whereabouts of my musket, beyond that
it was somewhere in my Lord Wellington&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; But my
Englishman was either a very honest fellow, or else extremely
thirsty, and at last contrived to advertise me of his new
position.&nbsp; Now, the English sentry in Castile, and the
wounded hero in the Durham public-house, were one and the same
person; and if he had been a little less drunk, or myself less
lively in getting away, the travels of M. St. Ives might have
come to an untimely end.</p>
<p>I suppose this woke me up; it stirred in me besides a spirit
of opposition, and in spite of cold, darkness, the highwaymen and
the footpads, I determined to walk right on till breakfast-time:
a happy resolution, which enabled me to observe one of those
traits of manners which at once depict a country and condemn
it.&nbsp; It was near midnight when I saw, a great way ahead of
me, the light of many torches; presently after, the sound of
wheels reached me, and the slow tread of feet, and soon I had
joined myself to the rear of a sordid, silent, and lugubrious
procession, such as we see in dreams.&nbsp; Close on a hundred
persons marched by torchlight in unbroken silence; in their midst
a cart, and in the cart, on an inclined platform, the dead body
of a man&mdash;the centre-piece of this solemnity, the hero whose
obsequies we were come forth at this unusual hour to
celebrate.&nbsp; It was but a plain, dingy old fellow of fifty or
sixty, his throat cut, his shirt turned over as though to show
the wound.&nbsp; Blue trousers and brown socks completed his
attire, if we can talk so of the dead.&nbsp; He had a horrid look
of a waxwork.&nbsp; In the tossing of the lights he seemed to
make faces and mouths at us, to frown, and to be at times upon
the point of speech.&nbsp; The cart, with this shabby and tragic
freight, and surrounded by its silent escort and bright torches,
continued for some distance to creak along the high-road, and I
to follow it in amazement, which was soon exchanged for
horror.&nbsp; At the corner of a lane the procession stopped,
and, as the torches ranged themselves along the hedgerow-side, I
became aware of a grave dug in the midst of the thoroughfare, and
a provision of quicklime piled in the ditch.&nbsp; The cart was
backed to the margin, the body slung off the platform and dumped
into the grave with an irreverent roughness.&nbsp; A sharpened
stake had hitherto served it for a pillow.&nbsp; It was now
withdrawn, held in its place by several volunteers, and a fellow
with a heavy mallet (the sound of which still haunts me at night)
drove it home through the bosom of the corpse.&nbsp; The hole was
filled with quicklime, and the bystanders, as if relieved of some
oppression, broke at once into a sound of whispered speech.</p>
<p>My shirt stuck to me, my heart had almost ceased beating, and
I found my tongue with difficulty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; I gasped to a neighbour,
&lsquo;what is this? what has he done? is it allowed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, where do you come from?&rsquo; replied the
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a traveller, sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and a
total stranger in this part of the country.&nbsp; I had lost my
way when I saw your torches, and came by chance on
this&mdash;this incredible scene.&nbsp; Who was the
man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A suicide,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay, he was a
bad one, was Johnnie Green.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It appeared this was a wretch who had committed many barbarous
murders, and being at last upon the point of discovery fell of
his own hand.&nbsp; And the nightmare at the crossroads was the
regular punishment, according to the laws of England, for an act
which the Romans honoured as a virtue!&nbsp; Whenever an
Englishman begins to prate of civilisation (as, indeed,
it&rsquo;s a defect they are rather prone to), I hear the
measured blows of a mallet, see the bystanders crowd with torches
about the grave, smile a little to myself in conscious
superiority&mdash;and take a thimbleful of brandy for the
stomach&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>I believe it must have been at my next stage, for I remember
going to bed extremely early, that I came to the model of a good
old-fashioned English inn, and was attended on by the picture of
a pretty chambermaid.&nbsp; We had a good many pleasant passages
as she waited table or warmed my bed for me with a devil of a
brass warming pan, fully larger than herself; and as she was no
less pert than she was pretty, she may be said to have given
rather better than she took.&nbsp; I cannot tell why (unless it
were for the sake of her saucy eyes), but I made her my
confidante, told her I was attached to a young lady in Scotland,
and received the encouragement of her sympathy, mingled and
connected with a fair amount of rustic wit.&nbsp; While I slept
the down-mail stopped for supper; it chanced that one of the
passengers left behind a copy of the <i>Edinburgh Courant</i>,
and the next morning my pretty chambermaid set the paper before
me at breakfast, with the remark that there was some news from my
lady-love.&nbsp; I took it eagerly, hoping to find some further
word of our escape, in which I was disappointed; and I was about
to lay it down, when my eye fell on a paragraph immediately
concerning me.&nbsp; Faa was in hospital, grievously sick, and
warrants were out for the arrest of Sim and Candlish.&nbsp; These
two men had shown themselves very loyal to me.&nbsp; This trouble
emerging, the least I could do was to be guided by a similar
loyalty to them.&nbsp; Suppose my visit to my uncle crowned with
some success, and my finances re-established, I determined I
should immediately return to Edinburgh, put their case in the
hands of a good lawyer, and await events.&nbsp; So my mind was
very lightly made up to what proved a mighty serious
matter.&nbsp; Candlish and Sim were all very well in their way,
and I do sincerely trust I should have been at some pains to help
them, had there been nothing else.&nbsp; But in truth my heart
and my eyes were set on quite another matter, and I received the
news of their tribulation almost with joy.&nbsp; That is never a
bad wind that blows where we want to go, and you may be sure
there was nothing unwelcome in a circumstance that carried me
back to Edinburgh and Flora.&nbsp; From that hour I began to
indulge myself with the making of imaginary scenes and
interviews, in which I confounded the aunt, flattered Ronald, and
now in the witty, now in the sentimental manner, declared my love
and received the assurance of its return.&nbsp; By means of this
exercise my resolution daily grew stronger, until at last I had
piled together such a mass of obstinacy as it would have taken a
cataclysm of nature to subvert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I to the chambermaid, &lsquo;here is
news of my lady-love indeed, and very good news too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All that day, in the teeth of a keen winter wind, I hugged
myself in my plaid, and it was as though her arms were flung
around me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII&mdash;I FOLLOW A COVERED CART NEARLY TO MY
DESTINATION</h2>
<p>At last I began to draw near, by reasonable stages, to the
neighbourhood of Wakefield; and the name of Mr. Burchell Fenn
came to the top in my memory.&nbsp; This was the gentleman (the
reader may remember) who made a trade of forwarding the escape of
French prisoners.&nbsp; How he did so: whether he had a
sign-board, <i>Escapes forwarded</i>, <i>apply within</i>; what
he charged for his services, or whether they were gratuitous and
charitable, were all matters of which I was at once ignorant and
extremely curious.&nbsp; Thanks to my proficiency in English, and
Mr. Romaine&rsquo;s bank-notes, I was getting on swimmingly
without him; but the trouble was that I could not be easy till I
had come to the bottom of these mysteries, and it was my
difficulty that I knew nothing of him beyond the name.&nbsp; I
knew not his trade beyond that of Forwarder of
Escapes&mdash;whether he lived in town or country, whether he
were rich or poor, nor by what kind of address I was to gain his
confidence.&nbsp; It would have a very bad appearance to go along
the highwayside asking after a man of whom I could give so scanty
an account; and I should look like a fool, indeed, if I were to
present myself at his door and find the police in
occupation!&nbsp; The interest of the conundrum, however, tempted
me, and I turned aside from my direct road to pass by Wakefield;
kept my ears pricked, as I went, for any mention of his name, and
relied for the rest on my good fortune.&nbsp; If Luck (who must
certainly be feminine) favoured me as far as to throw me in the
man&rsquo;s way, I should owe the lady a candle; if not, I could
very readily console myself.&nbsp; In this experimental humour,
and with so little to help me, it was a miracle that I should
have brought my enterprise to a good end; and there are several
saints in the calendar who might be happy to exchange with St.
Ives!</p>
<p>I had slept that night in a good inn at Wakefield, made my
breakfast by candle-light with the passengers of an up-coach, and
set off in a very ill temper with myself and my
surroundings.&nbsp; It was still early; the air raw and cold; the
sun low, and soon to disappear under a vast canopy of rain-clouds
that had begun to assemble in the north-west, and from that
quarter invaded the whole width of the heaven.&nbsp; Already the
rain fell in crystal rods; already the whole face of the country
sounded with the discharge of drains and ditches; and I looked
forward to a day of downpour and the hell of wet clothes, in
which particular I am as dainty as a cat.&nbsp; At a corner of
the road, and by the last glint of the drowning sun, I spied a
covered cart, of a kind that I thought I had never seen before,
preceding me at the foot&rsquo;s pace of jaded horses.&nbsp;
Anything is interesting to a pedestrian that can help him to
forget the miseries of a day of rain; and I bettered my pace and
gradually overtook the vehicle.</p>
<p>The nearer I came, the more it puzzled me.&nbsp; It was much
such a cart as I am told the calico printers use, mounted on two
wheels, and furnished with a seat in front for the driver.&nbsp;
The interior closed with a door, and was of a bigness to contain
a good load of calico, or (at a pinch and if it were necessary)
four or five persons.&nbsp; But, indeed, if human beings were
meant to travel there, they had my pity!&nbsp; They must travel
in the dark, for there was no sign of a window; and they would be
shaken all the way like a phial of doctor&rsquo;s stuff, for the
cart was not only ungainly to look at&mdash;it was besides very
imperfectly balanced on the one pair of wheels, and pitched
unconscionably.&nbsp; Altogether, if I had any glancing idea that
the cart was really a carriage, I had soon dismissed it; but I
was still inquisitive as to what it should contain, and where it
had come from.&nbsp; Wheels and horses were splashed with many
different colours of mud, as though they had come far and across
a considerable diversity of country.&nbsp; The driver continually
and vainly plied his whip.&nbsp; It seemed to follow they had
made a long, perhaps an all-night, stage; and that the driver, at
that early hour of a little after eight in the morning, already
felt himself belated.&nbsp; I looked for the name of the
proprietor on the shaft, and started outright.&nbsp; Fortune had
favoured the careless: it was Burchell Fenn!</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wet morning, my man,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>The driver, a loutish fellow, shock-headed and turnip-faced,
returned not a word to my salutation, but savagely flogged his
horses.&nbsp; The tired animals, who could scarce put the one
foot before the other, paid no attention to his cruelty; and I
continued without effort to maintain my position alongside,
smiling to myself at the futility of his attempts, and at the
same time pricked with curiosity as to why he made them.&nbsp; I
made no such formidable a figure as that a man should flee when I
accosted him; and my conscience not being entirely clear, I was
more accustomed to be uneasy myself than to see others
timid.&nbsp; Presently he desisted, and put back his whip in the
holster with the air of a man vanquished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you would run away from me?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, come, that&rsquo;s not English.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg pardon, master: no offence meant,&rsquo; he said,
touching his hat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And none taken!&rsquo; cried I.&nbsp; &lsquo;All I
desire is a little gaiety by the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I understood him to say he didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;take with
gaiety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I will try you with something else,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I can be all things to all men, like the
apostle!&nbsp; I dare to say I have travelled with heavier
fellows than you in my time, and done famously well with
them.&nbsp; Are you going home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a goin&rsquo; home, I am,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very fortunate circumstance for me!&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;At this rate we shall see a good deal of each
other, going the same way; and, now I come to think of it, why
should you not give me a cast?&nbsp; There is room beside you on
the bench.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With a sudden snatch, he carried the cart two yards into the
roadway.&nbsp; The horses plunged and came to a stop.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; he said, menacing me with the
whip.&nbsp; &lsquo;None o&rsquo; that with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None of what?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I asked you
for a lift, but I have no idea of taking one by force.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got to take care of the cart and
&rsquo;orses, I have,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
take up with no runagate vagabones, you see, else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought to thank you for your touching
confidence,&rsquo; said I, approaching carelessly nearer as I
spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I admit the road is solitary hereabouts,
and no doubt an accident soon happens.&nbsp; Little fear of
anything of the kind with you!&nbsp; I like you for it, like your
prudence, like that pastoral shyness of disposition.&nbsp; But
why not put it out of my power to hurt?&nbsp; Why not open the
door and bestow me here in the box, or whatever you please to
call it?&rsquo; And I laid my hand demonstratively on the body of
the cart.</p>
<p>He had been timorous before; but at this, he seemed to lose
the power of speech a moment, and stared at me in a perfect
enthusiasm of fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;The idea is
good.&nbsp; I should be safe in there if I were the monster
Williams himself.&nbsp; The great thing is to have me under lock
and key.&nbsp; For it does lock; it is locked now,&rsquo; said I,
trying the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>A propos</i>, what have you for
a cargo?&nbsp; It must be precious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He found not a word to answer.</p>
<p>Rat-tat-tat, I went upon the door like a well-drilled
footman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any one at home?&rsquo; I said, and stooped to
listen.</p>
<p>There came out of the interior a stifled sneeze, the first of
an uncontrollable paroxysm; another followed immediately on the
heels of it; and then the driver turned with an oath, laid the
lash upon the horses with so much energy that they found their
heels again, and the whole equipage fled down the road at a
gallop.</p>
<p>At the first sound of the sneeze, I had started back like a
man shot.&nbsp; The next moment, a great light broke on my mind,
and I understood.&nbsp; Here was the secret of Fenn&rsquo;s
trade: this was how he forwarded the escape of prisoners, hawking
them by night about the country in his covered cart.&nbsp; There
had been Frenchmen close to me; he who had just sneezed was my
countryman, my comrade, perhaps already my friend!&nbsp; I took
to my heels in pursuit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold hard!&rsquo; I
shouted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all right!&nbsp;
Stop!&rsquo;&nbsp; But the driver only turned a white face on me
for a moment, and redoubled his efforts, bending forward, plying
his whip and crying to his horses; these lay themselves down to
the gallop and beat the highway with flying hoofs; and the cart
bounded after them among the ruts and fled in a halo of rain and
spattering mud.&nbsp; But a minute since, and it had been
trundling along like a lame cow; and now it was off as though
drawn by Apollo&rsquo;s coursers.&nbsp; There is no telling what
a man can do, until you frighten him!</p>
<p>It was as much as I could do myself, though I ran valiantly,
to maintain my distance; and that (since I knew my countrymen so
near) was become a chief point with me.&nbsp; A hundred yards
farther on the cart whipped out of the high-road into a lane
embowered with leafless trees, and became lost to view.&nbsp;
When I saw it next, the driver had increased his advantage
considerably, but all danger was at an end, and the horses had
again declined into a hobbling walk.&nbsp; Persuaded that they
could not escape me, I took my time, and recovered my breath as I
followed them.</p>
<p>Presently the lane twisted at right angles, and showed me a
gate and the beginning of a gravel sweep; and a little after, as
I continued to advance, a red brick house about seventy years
old, in a fine style of architecture, and presenting a front of
many windows to a lawn and garden.&nbsp; Behind, I could see
outhouses and the peaked roofs of stacks; and I judged that a
manor-house had in some way declined to be the residence of a
tenant-farmer, careless alike of appearances and substantial
comfort.&nbsp; The marks of neglect were visible on every side,
in flower-bushes straggling beyond the borders, in the ill-kept
turf, and in the broken windows that were incongruously patched
with paper or stuffed with rags.&nbsp; A thicket of trees, mostly
evergreen, fenced the place round and secluded it from the eyes
of prying neighbours.&nbsp; As I came in view of it, on that
melancholy winter&rsquo;s morning, in the deluge of the falling
rain, and with the wind that now rose in occasional gusts and
hooted over the old chimneys, the cart had already drawn up at
the front-door steps, and the driver was already in earnest
discourse with Mr. Burchell Fenn.&nbsp; He was standing with his
hands behind his back&mdash;a man of a gross, misbegotten face
and body, dewlapped like a bull and red as a harvest moon; and in
his jockey cap, blue coat and top boots, he had much the air of a
good, solid tenant-farmer.</p>
<p>The pair continued to speak as I came up the approach, but
received me at last in a sort of goggling silence.&nbsp; I had my
hat in my hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have the pleasure of addressing Mr. Burchell
Fenn?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The same, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Fenn, taking off his
jockey cap in answer to my civility, but with the distant look
and the tardy movements of one who continues to think of
something else.&nbsp; &lsquo;And who may you be?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall tell you afterwards,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Suffice it, in the meantime, that I come on
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to digest my answer laboriously, his mouth gaping,
his little eyes never straying from my face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suffer me to point out to you, sir,&rsquo; I resumed,
&lsquo;that this is a devil of a wet morning; and that the
chimney corner, and possibly a glass of something hot, are
clearly indicated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the rain was now grown to be a deluge; the gutters of
the house roared; the air was filled with the continuous,
strident crash.&nbsp; The stolidity of his face, on which the
rain streamed, was far from reassuring me.&nbsp; On the contrary,
I was aware of a distinct qualm of apprehension, which was not at
all lessened by a view of the driver, craning from his perch to
observe us with the expression of a fascinated bird.&nbsp; So we
stood silent, when the prisoner again began to sneeze from the
body of the cart; and at the sound, prompt as a transformation,
the driver had whipped up his horses and was shambling off round
the corner of the house, and Mr. Fenn, recovering his wits with a
gulp, had turned to the door behind him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in, come in, sir,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
beg your pardon, sir; the lock goes a trifle hard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, it took him a surprising time to open the door, which
was not only locked on the outside, but the lock seemed
rebellious from disuse; and when at last he stood back and
motioned me to enter before him, I was greeted on the threshold
by that peculiar and convincing sound of the rain echoing over
empty chambers.&nbsp; The entrance-hall, in which I now found
myself, was of a good size and good proportions; potted plants
occupied the corners; the paved floor was soiled with muddy
footprints and encumbered with straw; on a mahogany hall-table,
which was the only furniture, a candle had been stuck and
suffered to burn down&mdash;plainly a long while ago, for the
gutterings were green with mould.&nbsp; My mind, under these new
impressions, worked with unusual vivacity.&nbsp; I was here shut
off with Fenn and his hireling in a deserted house, a neglected
garden, and a wood of evergreens: the most eligible theatre for a
deed of darkness.&nbsp; There came to me a vision of two
flagstones raised in the hall-floor, and the driver putting in
the rainy afternoon over my grave, and the prospect displeased me
extremely.&nbsp; I felt I had carried my pleasantry as far as was
safe; I must lose no time in declaring my true character, and I
was even choosing the words in which I was to begin, when the
hall-door was slammed-to behind me with a bang, and I turned,
dropping my stick as I did so, in time&mdash;and not any more
than time&mdash;to save my life.</p>
<p>The surprise of the onslaught and the huge weight of my
assailant gave him the advantage.&nbsp; He had a pistol in his
right hand of a portentous size, which it took me all my strength
to keep deflected.&nbsp; With his left arm he strained me to his
bosom, so that I thought I must be crushed or stifled.&nbsp; His
mouth was open, his face crimson, and he panted aloud with hard
animal sounds.&nbsp; The affair was as brief as it was hot and
sudden.&nbsp; The potations which had swelled and bloated his
carcase had already weakened the springs of energy.&nbsp; One
more huge effort, that came near to overpower me, and in which
the pistol happily exploded, and I felt his grasp slacken and
weakness come on his joints; his legs succumbed under his weight,
and he grovelled on his knees on the stone floor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Spare me!&rsquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>I had not only been abominably frightened; I was shocked
besides: my delicacy was in arms, like a lady to whom violence
should have been offered by a similar monster.&nbsp; I plucked
myself from his horrid contact, I snatched the pistol&mdash;even
discharged, it was a formidable weapon&mdash;and menaced him with
the butt.&nbsp; &lsquo;Spare you!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;you
beast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His voice died in his fat inwards, but his lips still
vehemently framed the same words of supplication.&nbsp; My anger
began to pass off, but not all my repugnance; the picture he made
revolted me, and I was impatient to be spared the further view of
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;stop this performance: it
sickens me.&nbsp; I am not going to kill you, do you hear?&nbsp;
I have need of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A look of relief, that I could almost have called beautiful,
dawned on his countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Anything&mdash;anything
you wish,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>Anything is a big word, and his use of it brought me for a
moment to a stand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, what do you mean?&rsquo; I
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you mean that you will blow the gaff on
the whole business?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He answered me Yes with eager asseverations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know Monsieur de Saint-Yves is in it; it was through
his papers we traced you,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you
consent to make a clean breast of the others?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do&mdash;I will!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
&rsquo;ole crew of &rsquo;em; there&rsquo;s good names among
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be king&rsquo;s evidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that all shall hang except yourself?&nbsp; You
damned villain!&rsquo; I broke out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Understand at
once that I am no spy or thief-taker.&nbsp; I am a kinsman of
Monsieur de St. Yves&mdash;here in his interest.&nbsp; Upon my
word, you have put your foot in it prettily, Mr. Burchell
Fenn!&nbsp; Come, stand up; don&rsquo;t grovel there.&nbsp; Stand
up, you lump of iniquity!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He scrambled to his feet.&nbsp; He was utterly unmanned, or it
might have gone hard with me yet; and I considered him
hesitating, as, indeed, there was cause.&nbsp; The man was a
double-dyed traitor: he had tried to murder me, and I had first
baffled his endeavours and then exposed and insulted him.&nbsp;
Was it wise to place myself any longer at his mercy?&nbsp; With
his help I should doubtless travel more quickly; doubtless also
far less agreeably; and there was everything to show that it
would be at a greater risk.&nbsp; In short, I should have washed
my hands of him on the spot, but for the temptation of the French
officers, whom I knew to be so near, and for whose society I felt
so great and natural an impatience.&nbsp; If I was to see
anything of my countrymen, it was clear I had first of all to
make my peace with Mr. Fenn; and that was no easy matter.&nbsp;
To make friends with any one implies concessions on both sides;
and what could I concede?&nbsp; What could I say of him, but that
he had proved himself a villain and a fool, and the worse
man?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;here has been rather a poor
piece of business, which I dare say you can have no pleasure in
calling to mind; and, to say truth, I would as readily forget it
myself.&nbsp; Suppose we try.&nbsp; Take back your pistol, which
smells very ill; put it in your pocket or wherever you had it
concealed.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; Now let us meet for the first
time.&mdash;Give you good morning, Mr. Fenn!&nbsp; I hope you do
very well.&nbsp; I come on the recommendation of my kinsman, the
Vicomte de St. Yves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean it?&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you
mean you will pass over our little scrimmage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, certainly!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It shows
you are a bold fellow, who may be trusted to forget the business
when it comes to the point.&nbsp; There is nothing against you in
the little scrimmage, unless that your courage is greater than
your strength.&nbsp; You are not so young as you once were, that
is all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I beg of you, sir, don&rsquo;t betray me to the
Vis-count,&rsquo; he pleaded.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not deny
but what my &rsquo;eart failed me a trifle; but it was only a
word, sir, what anybody might have said in the &rsquo;eat of the
moment, and over with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is quite my
own opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The way I came to be anxious about the
Vis-count,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;is that I believe he might
be induced to form an &rsquo;asty judgment.&nbsp; And the
business, in a pecuniary point of view, is all that I could ask;
only trying, sir&mdash;very trying.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s making an
old man of me before my time.&nbsp; You might have observed
yourself, sir, that I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t got the knees I once
&rsquo;ad.&nbsp; The knees and the breathing, there&rsquo;s where
it takes me.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m very sure, sir, I address a
gentleman as would be the last to make trouble between
friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure you do me no more than justice,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;and I shall think it quite unnecessary to dwell on any
of these passing circumstances in my report to the
Vicomte.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which you do favour him (if you&rsquo;ll excuse me
being so bold as to mention it) exac&rsquo;ly!&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should have known you anywheres.&nbsp; May I
offer you a pot of &rsquo;ome-brewed ale, sir?&nbsp; By your
leave!&nbsp; This way, if you please.&nbsp; I am &rsquo;eartily
grateful&mdash;&rsquo;eartily pleased to be of any service to a
gentleman like you, sir, which is related to the Vis-count, and
really a fambly of which you might well be proud!&nbsp; Take care
of the step, sir.&nbsp; You have good news of &rsquo;is
&rsquo;ealth, I trust? as well as that of Monseer the
Count?&rsquo;</p>
<p>God forgive me! the horrible fellow was still puffing and
panting with the fury of his assault, and already he had fallen
into an obsequious, wheedling familiarity like that of an old
servant,&mdash;already he was flattering me on my family
connections!</p>
<p>I followed him through the house into the stable-yard, where I
observed the driver washing the cart in a shed.&nbsp; He must
have heard the explosion of the pistol.&nbsp; He could not choose
but hear it: the thing was shaped like a little blunderbuss,
charged to the mouth, and made a report like a piece of field
artillery.&nbsp; He had heard, he had paid no attention; and now,
as we came forth by the back-door, he raised for a moment a pale
and tell-tale face that was as direct as a confession.&nbsp; The
rascal had expected to see Fenn come forth alone; he was waiting
to be called on for that part of sexton, which I had already
allotted to him in fancy.</p>
<p>I need not detain the reader very long with any description of
my visit to the back-kitchen; of how we mulled our ale there, and
mulled it very well; nor of how we sat talking, Fenn like an old,
faithful, affectionate dependant, and I&mdash;well!&nbsp; I
myself fallen into a mere admiration of so much impudence, that
transcended words, and had very soon conquered animosity.&nbsp; I
took a fancy to the man, he was so vast a humbug.&nbsp; I began
to see a kind of beauty in him, his <i>aplomb</i> was so
majestic.&nbsp; I never knew a rogue to cut so fat; his villainy
was ample, like his belly, and I could scarce find it in my heart
to hold him responsible for either.&nbsp; He was good enough to
drop into the autobiographical; telling me how the farm, in spite
of the war and the high prices, had proved a disappointment; how
there was &lsquo;a sight of cold, wet land as you come along the
&rsquo;igh-road&rsquo;; how the winds and rains and the seasons
had been misdirected, it seemed &lsquo;o&rsquo; purpose&rsquo;;
how Mrs. Fenn had died&mdash;&lsquo;I lost her coming two year
agone; a remarkable fine woman, my old girl, sir! if you&rsquo;ll
excuse me,&rsquo; he added, with a burst of humility.&nbsp; In
short, he gave me an opportunity of studying John Bull, as I may
say, stuffed naked&mdash;his greed, his usuriousness, his
hypocrisy, his perfidy of the back-stairs, all swelled to the
superlative&mdash;such as was well worth the little disarray and
fluster of our passage in the hall.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;I MEET TWO OF MY COUNTRYMEN</h2>
<p>As soon as I judged it safe, and that was not before Burchell
Fenn had talked himself back into his breath and a complete good
humour, I proposed he should introduce me to the French officers,
henceforth to become my fellow-passengers.&nbsp; There were two
of them, it appeared, and my heart beat as I approached the
door.&nbsp; The specimen of Perfidious Albion whom I had just
been studying gave me the stronger zest for my
fellow-countrymen.&nbsp; I could have embraced them; I could have
wept on their necks.&nbsp; And all the time I was going to a
disappointment.</p>
<p>It was in a spacious and low room, with an outlook on the
court, that I found them bestowed.&nbsp; In the good days of that
house the apartment had probably served as a library, for there
were traces of shelves along the wainscot.&nbsp; Four or five
mattresses lay on the floor in a corner, with a frowsy heap of
bedding; near by was a basin and a cube of soap; a rude
kitchen-table and some deal chairs stood together at the far end;
and the room was illuminated by no less than four windows, and
warmed by a little, crazy, sidelong grate, propped up with bricks
in the vent of a hospitable chimney, in which a pile of coals
smoked prodigiously and gave out a few starveling flames.&nbsp;
An old, frail, white-haired officer sat in one of the chairs,
which he had drawn close to this apology for a fire.&nbsp; He was
wrapped in a camlet cloak, of which the collar was turned up, his
knees touched the bars, his hands were spread in the very smoke,
and yet he shivered for cold.&nbsp; The second&mdash;a big,
florid, fine animal of a man, whose every gesture labelled him
the cock of the walk and the admiration of the ladies&mdash;had
apparently despaired of the fire, and now strode up and down,
sneezing hard, bitterly blowing his nose, and proffering a
continual stream of bluster, complaint, and barrack-room
oaths.</p>
<p>Fenn showed me in with the brief form of introduction:
&lsquo;Gentlemen all, this here&rsquo;s another fare!&rsquo; and
was gone again at once.&nbsp; The old man gave me but the one
glance out of lack-lustre eyes; and even as he looked a shiver
took him as sharp as a hiccough.&nbsp; But the other, who
represented to admiration the picture of a Beau in a Catarrh,
stared at me arrogantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who are you, sir?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>I made the military salute to my superiors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Champdivers, private, Eighth of the Line,&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty business!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you
are going on with us?&nbsp; Three in a cart, and a great
trolloping private at that!&nbsp; And who is to pay for you, my
fine fellow?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If monsieur comes to that,&rsquo; I answered civilly,
&lsquo;who paid for him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if you choose to play the wit!&rsquo; said
he,&mdash;and began to rail at large upon his destiny, the
weather, the cold, the danger and the expense of the escape, and,
above all, the cooking of the accursed English.&nbsp; It seemed
to annoy him particularly that I should have joined their
party.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you knew what you were doing, thirty
thousand millions of pigs! you would keep yourself to
yourself!&nbsp; The horses can&rsquo;t drag the cart; the roads
are all ruts and swamps.&nbsp; No longer ago than last night the
Colonel and I had to march half the way&mdash;thunder of
God!&mdash;half the way to the knees in mud&mdash;and I with this
infernal cold&mdash;and the danger of detection!&nbsp; Happily we
met no one: a desert&mdash;a real desert&mdash;like the whole
abominable country!&nbsp; Nothing to eat&mdash;no, sir, there is
nothing to eat but raw cow and greens boiled in water&mdash;nor
to drink but Worcestershire sauce!&nbsp; Now I, with my catarrh,
I have no appetite; is it not so?&nbsp; Well, if I were in
France, I should have a good soup with a crust in it, an
omelette, a fowl in rice, a partridge in cabbages&mdash;things to
tempt me, thunder of God!&nbsp; But here&mdash;day of
God!&mdash;what a country!&nbsp; And cold, too!&nbsp; They talk
about Russia&mdash;this is all the cold I want!&nbsp; And the
people&mdash;look at them!&nbsp; What a race!&nbsp; Never any
handsome men; never any fine officers!&rsquo;&mdash;and he looked
down complacently for a moment at his waist&mdash;&lsquo;And the
women&mdash;what faggots!&nbsp; No, that is one point clear, I
cannot stomach the English!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was something in this man so antipathetic to me, as sent
the mustard into my nose.&nbsp; I can never bear your bucks and
dandies, even when they are decent-looking and well dressed; and
the Major&mdash;for that was his rank&mdash;was the image of a
flunkey in good luck.&nbsp; Even to be in agreement with him, or
to seem to be so, was more than I could make out to endure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You could scarce be expected to stomach them,&rsquo;
said I civilly, &lsquo;after having just digested your
parole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He whipped round on his heel and turned on me a countenance
which I dare say he imagined to be awful; but another fit of
sneezing cut him off ere he could come the length of speech.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not tried the dish myself,&rsquo; I took the
opportunity to add.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is said to be
unpalatable.&nbsp; Did monsieur find it so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>With surprising vivacity the Colonel woke from his
lethargy.&nbsp; He was between us ere another word could
pass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shame, gentlemen!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is this
a time for Frenchmen and fellow-soldiers to fall out?&nbsp; We
are in the midst of our enemies; a quarrel, a loud word, may
suffice to plunge us back into irretrievable distress.&nbsp;
<i>Monsieur le Commandant</i>, you have been gravely
offended.&nbsp; I make it my request, I make it my
prayer&mdash;if need be, I give you my orders&mdash;that the
matter shall stand by until we come safe to France.&nbsp; Then,
if you please, I will serve you in any capacity.&nbsp; And for
you, young man, you have shown all the cruelty and carelessness
of youth.&nbsp; This gentleman is your superior; he is no longer
young&rsquo;&mdash;at which word you are to conceive the
Major&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is admitted he has broken his
parole.&nbsp; I know not his reason, and no more do you.&nbsp; It
might be patriotism in this hour of our country&rsquo;s
adversity, it might be humanity, necessity; you know not what in
the least, and you permit yourself to reflect on his
honour.&nbsp; To break parole may be a subject for pity and not
derision.&nbsp; I have broken mine&mdash;I, a colonel of the
Empire.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; I have been years negotiating my
exchange, and it cannot be managed; those who have influence at
the Ministry of War continually rush in before me, and I have to
wait, and my daughter at home is in a decline.&nbsp; I am going
to see my daughter at last, and it is my only concern lest I
should have delayed too long.&nbsp; She is ill, and very
ill,&mdash;at death&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; Nothing is left me but my
daughter, my Emperor, and my honour; and I give my honour, blame
me for it who dare!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this my heart smote me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;think no
more of what I have said!&nbsp; A parole? what is a parole
against life and death and love?&nbsp; I ask your pardon; this
gentleman&rsquo;s also.&nbsp; As long as I shall be with you, you
shall not have cause to complain of me again.&nbsp; I pray God
you will find your daughter alive and restored.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is past praying for,&rsquo; said the Colonel; and
immediately the brief fire died out of him, and, returning to the
hearth, he relapsed into his former abstraction.</p>
<p>But I was not so easy to compose.&nbsp; The knowledge of the
poor gentleman&rsquo;s trouble, and the sight of his face, had
filled me with the bitterness of remorse; and I insisted upon
shaking hands with the Major (which he did with a very ill
grace), and abounded in palinodes and apologies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;who am I to
talk?&nbsp; I am in the luck to be a private soldier; I have no
parole to give or to keep; once I am over the rampart, I am as
free as air.&nbsp; I beg you to believe that I regret from my
soul the use of these ungenerous expressions.&nbsp; Allow me . .
. Is there no way in this damned house to attract
attention?&nbsp; Where is this fellow, Fenn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I ran to one of the windows and threw it open.&nbsp; Fenn, who
was at the moment passing below in the court, cast up his arms
like one in despair, called to me to keep back, plunged into the
house, and appeared next moment in the doorway of the
chamber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, sir!&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;keep away from those
there windows.&nbsp; A body might see you from the back
lane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is registered,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Henceforward I will be a mouse for precaution and a ghost
for invisibility.&nbsp; But in the meantime, for God&rsquo;s
sake, fetch us a bottle of brandy!&nbsp; Your room is as damp as
the bottom of a well, and these gentlemen are perishing of
cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So soon as I had paid him (for everything, I found, must be
paid in advance), I turned my attention to the fire, and whether
because I threw greater energy into the business, or because the
coals were now warmed and the time ripe, I soon started a blaze
that made the chimney roar again.&nbsp; The shine of it, in that
dark, rainy day, seemed to reanimate the Colonel like a blink of
sun.&nbsp; With the outburst of the flames, besides, a draught
was established, which immediately delivered us from the plague
of smoke; and by the time Fenn returned, carrying a bottle under
his arm and a single tumbler in his hand, there was already an
air of gaiety in the room that did the heart good.</p>
<p>I poured out some of the brandy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Colonel,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am a young man and a
private soldier.&nbsp; I have not been long in this room, and
already I have shown the petulance that belongs to the one
character and the ill manners that you may look for in the
other.&nbsp; Have the humanity to pass these slips over, and
honour me so far as to accept this glass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lad,&rsquo; says he, waking up and blinking at me
with an air of suspicion, &lsquo;are you sure you can afford
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I assured him I could.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank you, then: I am very cold.&rsquo;&nbsp; He took
the glass out, and a little colour came in his face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I thank you again,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;It goes to
the heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Major, when I motioned him to help himself, did so with a
good deal of liberality; continued to do so for the rest of the
morning, now with some sort of apology, now with none at all; and
the bottle began to look foolish before dinner was served.&nbsp;
It was such a meal as he had himself predicted: beef, greens,
potatoes, mustard in a teacup, and beer in a brown jug that was
all over hounds, horses, and hunters, with a fox at the fat end
and a gigantic John Bull&mdash;for all the world like
Fenn&mdash;sitting in the midst in a bob-wig and smoking
tobacco.&nbsp; The beer was a good brew, but not good enough for
the Major; he laced it with brandy&mdash;for his cold, he said;
and in this curative design the remainder of the bottle ebbed
away.&nbsp; He called my attention repeatedly to the
circumstance; helped me pointedly to the dregs, threw the bottle
in the air and played tricks with it; and at last, having
exhausted his ingenuity, and seeing me remain quite blind to
every hint, he ordered and paid for another himself.</p>
<p>As for the Colonel, he ate nothing, sat sunk in a muse, and
only awoke occasionally to a sense of where he was, and what he
was supposed to be doing.&nbsp; On each of these occasions he
showed a gratitude and kind courtesy that endeared him to me
beyond expression.&nbsp; &lsquo;Champdivers, my lad, your
health!&rsquo; he would say.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Major and I had a
very arduous march last night, and I positively thought I should
have eaten nothing, but your fortunate idea of the brandy has
made quite a new man of me&mdash;quite a new man.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he would fall to with a great air of heartiness, cut himself
a mouthful, and, before he had swallowed it, would have forgotten
his dinner, his company, the place where he then was, and the
escape he was engaged on, and become absorbed in the vision of a
sick-room and a dying girl in France.&nbsp; The pathos of this
continual preoccupation, in a man so old, sick, and over-weary,
and whom I looked upon as a mere bundle of dying bones and
death-pains, put me wholly from my victuals: it seemed there was
an element of sin, a kind of rude bravado of youth, in the mere
relishing of food at the same table with this tragic father; and
though I was well enough used to the coarse, plain diet of the
English, I ate scarce more than himself.&nbsp; Dinner was hardly
over before he succumbed to a lethargic sleep; lying on one of
the mattresses with his limbs relaxed, and his breath seemingly
suspended&mdash;the very image of dissolution.</p>
<p>This left the Major and myself alone at the table.&nbsp; You
must not suppose our <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> was
long, but it was a lively period while it lasted.&nbsp; He drank
like a fish or an Englishman; shouted, beat the table, roared out
songs, quarrelled, made it up again, and at last tried to throw
the dinner-plates through the window, a feat of which he was at
that time quite incapable.&nbsp; For a party of fugitives,
condemned to the most rigorous discretion, there was never seen
so noisy a carnival; and through it all the Colonel continued to
sleep like a child.&nbsp; Seeing the Major so well advanced, and
no retreat possible, I made a fair wind of a foul one, keeping
his glass full, pushing him with toasts; and sooner than I could
have dared to hope, he became drowsy and incoherent.&nbsp; With
the wrong-headedness of all such sots, he would not be persuaded
to lie down upon one of the mattresses until I had stretched
myself upon another.&nbsp; But the comedy was soon over; soon he
slept the sleep of the just, and snored like a military music;
and I might get up again and face (as best I could) the excessive
tedium of the afternoon.</p>
<p>I had passed the night before in a good bed; I was denied the
resource of slumber; and there was nothing open for me but to
pace the apartment, maintain the fire, and brood on my
position.&nbsp; I compared yesterday and to-day&mdash;the safety,
comfort, jollity, open-air exercise and pleasant roadside inns of
the one, with the tedium, anxiety, and discomfort of the
other.&nbsp; I remembered that I was in the hands of Fenn, who
could not be more false&mdash;though he might be more
vindictive&mdash;than I fancied him.&nbsp; I looked forward to
nights of pitching in the covered cart, and days of monotony in I
knew not what hiding-places; and my heart failed me, and I was in
two minds whether to slink off ere it was too late, and return to
my former solitary way of travel.&nbsp; But the Colonel stood in
the path.&nbsp; I had not seen much of him; but already I judged
him a man of a childlike nature&mdash;with that sort of innocence
and courtesy that, I think, is only to be found in old soldiers
or old priests&mdash;and broken with years and sorrow.&nbsp; I
could not turn my back on his distress; could not leave him alone
with the selfish trooper who snored on the next mattress.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Champdivers, my lad, your health!&rsquo; said a voice in
my ear, and stopped me&mdash;and there are few things I am more
glad of in the retrospect than that it did.</p>
<p>It must have been about four in the afternoon&mdash;at least
the rain had taken off, and the sun was setting with some wintry
pomp&mdash;when the current of my reflections was effectually
changed by the arrival of two visitors in a gig.&nbsp; They were
farmers of the neighbourhood, I suppose&mdash;big, burly fellows
in great-coats and top-boots, mightily flushed with liquor when
they arrived, and, before they left, inimitably drunk.&nbsp; They
stayed long in the kitchen with Burchell, drinking, shouting,
singing, and keeping it up; and the sound of their merry
minstrelsy kept me a kind of company.&nbsp; The night fell, and
the shine of the fire brightened and blinked on the panelled
wall.&nbsp; Our illuminated windows must have been visible not
only from the back lane of which Fenn had spoken, but from the
court where the farmers&rsquo; gig awaited them.&nbsp; In the far
end of the firelit room lay my companions, the one silent, the
other clamorously noisy, the images of death and
drunkenness.&nbsp; Little wonder if I were tempted to join in the
choruses below, and sometimes could hardly refrain from laughter,
and sometimes, I believe, from tears&mdash;so unmitigated was the
tedium, so cruel the suspense, of this period.</p>
<p>At last, about six at night, I should fancy, the noisy
minstrels appeared in the court, headed by Fenn with a lantern,
and knocking together as they came.&nbsp; The visitors clambered
noisily into the gig, one of them shook the reins, and they were
snatched out of sight and hearing with a suddenness that partook
of the nature of prodigy.&nbsp; I am well aware there is a
Providence for drunken men, that holds the reins for them and
presides over their troubles; doubtless he had his work cut out
for him with this particular gigful!&nbsp; Fenn rescued his toes
with an ejaculation from under the departing wheels, and turned
at once with uncertain steps and devious lantern to the far end
of the court.&nbsp; There, through the open doors of a
coach-house, the shock-headed lad was already to be seen drawing
forth the covered cart.&nbsp; If I wished any private talk with
our host, it must be now or never.</p>
<p>Accordingly I groped my way downstairs, and came to him as he
looked on at and lighted the harnessing of the horses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The hour approaches when we have to part,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;and I shall be obliged if you will tell your servant to
drop me at the nearest point for Dunstable.&nbsp; I am determined
to go so far with our friends, Colonel X and Major Y, but my
business is peremptory, and it takes me to the neighbourhood of
Dunstable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Orders were given to my satisfaction, with an obsequiousness
that seemed only inflamed by his potations.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;TRAVELS OF THE COVERED CART</h2>
<p>My companions were aroused with difficulty: the Colonel, poor
old gentleman, to a sort of permanent dream, in which you could
say of him only that he was very deaf and anxiously polite; the
Major still maudlin drunk.&nbsp; We had a dish of tea by the
fireside, and then issued like criminals into the scathing cold
of the night.&nbsp; For the weather had in the meantime
changed.&nbsp; Upon the cessation of the rain, a strict frost had
succeeded.&nbsp; The moon, being young, was already near the
zenith when we started, glittered everywhere on sheets of ice,
and sparkled in ten thousand icicles.&nbsp; A more unpromising
night for a journey it was hard to conceive.&nbsp; But in the
course of the afternoon the horses had been well roughed; and
King (for such was the name of the shock-headed lad) was very
positive that he could drive us without misadventure.&nbsp; He
was as good as his word; indeed, despite a gawky air, he was
simply invaluable in his present employment, showing marked
sagacity in all that concerned the care of horses, and guiding us
by one short cut after another for days, and without a fault.</p>
<p>The interior of that engine of torture, the covered cart, was
fitted with a bench, on which we took our places; the door was
shut; in a moment, the night closed upon us solid and stifling;
and we felt that we were being driven carefully out of the
courtyard.&nbsp; Careful was the word all night, and it was an
alleviation of our miseries that we did not often enjoy.&nbsp; In
general, as we were driven the better part of the night and day,
often at a pretty quick pace and always through a labyrinth of
the most infamous country lanes and by-roads, we were so bruised
upon the bench, so dashed against the top and sides of the cart,
that we reached the end of a stage in truly pitiable case,
sometimes flung ourselves down without the formality of eating,
made but one sleep of it until the hour of departure returned,
and were only properly awakened by the first jolt of the renewed
journey.&nbsp; There were interruptions, at times, that we hailed
as alleviations.&nbsp; At times the cart was bogged, once it was
upset, and we must alight and lend the driver the assistance of
our arms; at times, too (as on the occasion when I had first
encountered it), the horses gave out, and we had to trail
alongside in mud or frost until the first peep of daylight, or
the approach to a hamlet or a high road, bade us disappear like
ghosts into our prison.</p>
<p>The main roads of England are incomparable for excellence, of
a beautiful smoothness, very ingeniously laid down, and so well
kept that in most weathers you could take your dinner off any
part of them without distaste.&nbsp; On them, to the note of the
bugle, the mail did its sixty miles a day; innumerable chaises
whisked after the bobbing postboys; or some young blood would
flit by in a curricle and tandem, to the vast delight and danger
of the lieges.&nbsp; On them, the slow-pacing waggons made a
music of bells, and all day long the travellers on horse-back and
the travellers on foot (like happy Mr. St. Ives so little a while
before!) kept coming and going, and baiting and gaping at each
other, as though a fair were due, and they were gathering to it
from all England.&nbsp; No, nowhere in the world is travel so
great a pleasure as in that country.&nbsp; But unhappily our one
need was to be secret; and all this rapid and animated picture of
the road swept quite apart from us, as we lumbered up hill and
down dale, under hedge and over stone, among circuitous
byways.&nbsp; Only twice did I receive, as it were, a whiff of
the highway.&nbsp; The first reached my ears alone.&nbsp; I might
have been anywhere.&nbsp; I only knew I was walking in the dark
night and among ruts, when I heard very far off, over the silent
country that surrounded us, the guard&rsquo;s horn wailing its
signal to the next post-house for a change of horses.&nbsp; It
was like the voice of the day heard in darkness, a voice of the
world heard in prison, the note of a cock crowing in the
mid-seas&mdash;in short, I cannot tell you what it was like, you
will have to fancy for yourself&mdash;but I could have wept to
hear it.&nbsp; Once we were belated: the cattle could hardly
crawl, the day was at hand, it was a nipping, rigorous morning,
King was lashing his horses, I was giving an arm to the old
Colonel, and the Major was coughing in our rear.&nbsp; I must
suppose that King was a thought careless, being nearly in
desperation about his team, and, in spite of the cold morning,
breathing hot with his exertions.&nbsp; We came, at last, a
little before sunrise to the summit of a hill, and saw the
high-road passing at right angles through an open country of
meadows and hedgerow pollards; and not only the York mail,
speeding smoothly at the gallop of the four horses, but a
post-chaise besides, with the post-boy titupping briskly, and the
traveller himself putting his head out of the window, but whether
to breathe the dawn, or the better to observe the passage of the
mail, I do not know.&nbsp; So that we enjoyed for an instant a
picture of free life on the road, in its most luxurious forms of
despatch and comfort.&nbsp; And thereafter, with a poignant
feeling of contrast in our hearts, we must mount again into our
wheeled dungeon.</p>
<p>We came to our stages at all sorts of odd hours, and they were
in all kinds of odd places.&nbsp; I may say at once that my first
experience was my best.&nbsp; Nowhere again were we so well
entertained as at Burchell Fenn&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And this, I
suppose, was natural, and indeed inevitable, in so long and
secret a journey.&nbsp; The first stop, we lay six hours in a
barn standing by itself in a poor, marshy orchard, and packed
with hay; to make it more attractive, we were told it had been
the scene of an abominable murder, and was now haunted.&nbsp; But
the day was beginning to break, and our fatigue was too extreme
for visionary terrors.&nbsp; The second or third, we alighted on
a barren heath about midnight, built a fire to warm us under the
shelter of some thorns, supped like beggars on bread and a piece
of cold bacon, and slept like gipsies with our feet to the
fire.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, King was gone with the cart, I know
not where, to get a change of horses, and it was late in the dark
morning when he returned and we were able to resume our
journey.&nbsp; In the middle of another night, we came to a stop
by an ancient, whitewashed cottage of two stories; a privet hedge
surrounded it; the frosty moon shone blankly on the upper
windows; but through those of the kitchen the firelight was seen
glinting on the roof and reflected from the dishes on the
wall.&nbsp; Here, after much hammering on the door, King managed
to arouse an old crone from the chimney-corner chair, where she
had been dozing in the watch; and we were had in, and entertained
with a dish of hot tea.&nbsp; This old lady was an aunt of
Burchell Fenn&rsquo;s&mdash;and an unwilling partner in his
dangerous trade.&nbsp; Though the house stood solitary, and the
hour was an unlikely one for any passenger upon the road, King
and she conversed in whispers only.&nbsp; There was something
dismal, something of the sick-room, in this perpetual, guarded
sibilation.&nbsp; The apprehensions of our hostess insensibly
communicated themselves to every one present.&nbsp; We ate like
mice in a cat&rsquo;s ear; if one of us jingled a teaspoon, all
would start; and when the hour came to take the road again, we
drew a long breath of relief, and climbed to our places in the
covered cart with a positive sense of escape.&nbsp; The most of
our meals, however, were taken boldly at hedgerow alehouses,
usually at untimely hours of the day, when the clients were in
the field or the farmyard at labour.&nbsp; I shall have to tell
presently of our last experience of the sort, and how
unfortunately it miscarried; but as that was the signal for my
separation from my fellow-travellers, I must first finish with
them.</p>
<p>I had never any occasion to waver in my first judgment of the
Colonel.&nbsp; The old gentleman seemed to me, and still seems in
the retrospect, the salt of the earth.&nbsp; I had occasion to
see him in the extremes of hardship, hunger and cold; he was
dying, and he looked it; and yet I cannot remember any hasty,
harsh, or impatient word to have fallen from his lips.&nbsp; On
the contrary, he ever showed himself careful to please; and even
if he rambled in his talk, rambled always gently&mdash;like a
humane, half-witted old hero, true to his colours to the
last.&nbsp; I would not dare to say how often he awoke suddenly
from a lethargy, and told us again, as though we had never heard
it, the story of how he had earned the cross, how it had been
given him by the hand of the Emperor, and of the
innocent&mdash;and, indeed, foolish&mdash;sayings of his daughter
when he returned with it on his bosom.&nbsp; He had another
anecdote which he was very apt to give, by way of a rebuke, when
the Major wearied us beyond endurance with dispraises of the
English.&nbsp; This was an account of the <i>braves gens</i> with
whom he had been boarding.&nbsp; True enough, he was a man so
simple and grateful by nature, that the most common civilities
were able to touch him to the heart, and would remain written in
his memory; but from a thousand inconsiderable but conclusive
indications, I gathered that this family had really loved him,
and loaded him with kindness.&nbsp; They made a fire in his
bedroom, which the sons and daughters tended with their own
hands; letters from France were looked for with scarce more
eagerness by himself than by these alien sympathisers; when they
came, he would read them aloud in the parlour to the assembled
family, translating as he went.&nbsp; The Colonel&rsquo;s English
was elementary; his daughter not in the least likely to be an
amusing correspondent; and, as I conceived these scenes in the
parlour, I felt sure the interest centred in the Colonel himself,
and I thought I could feel in my own heart that mixture of the
ridiculous and the pathetic, the contest of tears and laughter,
which must have shaken the bosoms of the family.&nbsp; Their
kindness had continued till the end.&nbsp; It appears they were
privy to his flight, the camlet cloak had been lined expressly
for him, and he was the bearer of a letter from the daughter of
the house to his own daughter in Paris.&nbsp; The last evening,
when the time came to say good-night, it was tacitly known to all
that they were to look upon his face no more.&nbsp; He rose,
pleading fatigue, and turned to the daughter, who had been his
chief ally: &lsquo;You will permit me, my dear&mdash;to an old
and very unhappy soldier&mdash;and may God bless you for your
goodness!&rsquo;&nbsp; The girl threw her arms about his neck and
sobbed upon his bosom; the lady of the house burst into tears;
&lsquo;<i>et je vous le jure</i>, <i>le p&egrave;re se
mouchait</i>!&rsquo; quoth the Colonel, twisting his moustaches
with a cavalry air, and at the same time blinking the water from
his eyes at the mere recollection.</p>
<p>It was a good thought to me that he had found these friends in
captivity; that he had started on this fatal journey from so
cordial a farewell.&nbsp; He had broken his parole for his
daughter: that he should ever live to reach her sick-bed, that he
could continue to endure to an end the hardships, the crushing
fatigue, the savage cold, of our pilgrimage, I had early ceased
to hope.&nbsp; I did for him what I was able,&mdash;nursed him,
kept him covered, watched over his slumbers, sometimes held him
in my arms at the rough places of the road.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Champdivers,&rsquo; he once said, &lsquo;you are like a
son to me&mdash;like a son.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is good to remember,
though at the time it put me on the rack.&nbsp; All was to no
purpose.&nbsp; Fast as we were travelling towards France, he was
travelling faster still to another destination.&nbsp; Daily he
grew weaker and more indifferent.&nbsp; An old rustic accent of
Lower Normandy reappeared in his speech, from which it had long
been banished, and grew stronger; old words of the <i>patois</i>,
too: <i>Ouistreham</i>, <i>matrass&eacute;</i>, and others, the
sense of which we were sometimes unable to guess.&nbsp; On the
very last day he began again his eternal story of the cross and
the Emperor.&nbsp; The Major, who was particularly ill, or at
least particularly cross, uttered some angry words of
protest.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Pardonnez-moi</i>, <i>monsieur le
commandant</i>, <i>mais c&rsquo;est pour monsieur</i>,&rsquo;
said the Colonel: &lsquo;Monsieur has not yet heard the
circumstance, and is good enough to feel an
interest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Presently after, however, he began to lose
the thread of his narrative; and at last: &lsquo;<i>Qu&eacute;
que j&rsquo;ai</i>?&nbsp; <i>Je m&rsquo;embrouille</i>!&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;<i>Suffit</i>: <i>s&rsquo;m&rsquo;a la
donn&eacute;</i>, <i>et Berthe en &eacute;tait bien
contente</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; It struck me as the falling of the
curtain or the closing of the sepulchre doors.</p>
<p>Sure enough, in but a little while after, he fell into a sleep
as gentle as an infant&rsquo;s, which insensibly changed into the
sleep of death.&nbsp; I had my arm about his body at the time and
remarked nothing, unless it were that he once stretched himself a
little, so kindly the end came to that disastrous life.&nbsp; It
was only at our evening halt that the Major and I discovered we
were travelling alone with the poor clay.&nbsp; That night we
stole a spade from a field&mdash;I think near Market
Bosworth&mdash;and a little farther on, in a wood of young oak
trees and by the light of King&rsquo;s lantern, we buried the old
soldier of the Empire with both prayers and tears.</p>
<p>We had needs invent Heaven if it had not been revealed to us;
there are some things that fall so bitterly ill on this side
Time!&nbsp; As for the Major, I have long since forgiven
him.&nbsp; He broke the news to the poor Colonel&rsquo;s
daughter; I am told he did it kindly; and sure, nobody could have
done it without tears!&nbsp; His share of purgatory will be
brief; and in this world, as I could not very well praise him, I
have suppressed his name.&nbsp; The Colonel&rsquo;s also, for the
sake of his parole.&nbsp; <i>Requiescat</i>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV&mdash;THE ADVENTURE OF THE ATTORNEY&rsquo;S
CLERK</h2>
<p>I have mentioned our usual course, which was to eat in
inconsiderable wayside hostelries, known to King.&nbsp; It was a
dangerous business; we went daily under fire to satisfy our
appetite, and put our head in the loin&rsquo;s mouth for a piece
of bread.&nbsp; Sometimes, to minimise the risk, we would all
dismount before we came in view of the house, straggle in
severally, and give what orders we pleased, like disconnected
strangers.&nbsp; In like manner we departed, to find the cart at
an appointed place, some half a mile beyond.&nbsp; The Colonel
and the Major had each a word or two of English&mdash;God help
their pronunciation!&nbsp; But they did well enough to order a
rasher and a pot or call a reckoning; and, to say truth, these
country folks did not give themselves the pains, and had scarce
the knowledge, to be critical.</p>
<p>About nine or ten at night the pains of hunger and cold drove
us to an alehouse in the flats of Bedfordshire, not far from
Bedford itself.&nbsp; In the inn kitchen was a long, lean,
characteristic-looking fellow of perhaps forty, dressed in
black.&nbsp; He sat on a settle by the fireside, smoking a long
pipe, such as they call a yard of clay.&nbsp; His hat and wig
were hanged upon the knob behind him, his head as bald as a
bladder of lard, and his expression very shrewd, cantankerous,
and inquisitive.&nbsp; He seemed to value himself above his
company, to give himself the airs of a man of the world among
that rustic herd; which was often no more than his due; being, as
I afterwards discovered, an attorney&rsquo;s clerk.&nbsp; I took
upon myself the more ungrateful part of arriving last; and by the
time I entered on the scene the Major was already served at a
side table.&nbsp; Some general conversation must have passed, and
I smelled danger in the air.&nbsp; The Major looked flustered,
the attorney&rsquo;s clerk triumphant, and three or four peasants
in smock-frocks (who sat about the fire to play chorus) had let
their pipes go out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give you good evening, sir!&rsquo; said the
attorney&rsquo;s clerk to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The same to you, sir,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think this one will do,&rsquo; quoth the clerk to the
yokels with a wink; and then, as soon as I had given my order,
&lsquo;Pray, sir, whither are you bound?&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am not one of those who
speak either of their business or their destination in houses of
public entertainment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A good answer,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and an excellent
principle.&nbsp; Sir, do you speak French?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, no, sir,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;A little
Spanish at your service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you know the French accent, perhaps?&rsquo; said
the clerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well do I do that!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
French accent?&nbsp; Why, I believe I can tell a Frenchman in ten
words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is a puzzle for you, then!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have no material doubt myself, but some of these
gentlemen are more backward.&nbsp; The lack of education, you
know.&nbsp; I make bold to say that a man cannot walk, cannot
hear, and cannot see, without the blessings of
education.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the Major, whose food plainly stuck in his
throat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, sir,&rsquo; pursued the clerk, &lsquo;let me have
the pleasure to hear your voice again.&nbsp; Where are you going,
did you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sare, I am go-ing to Lon-don,&rsquo; said the
Major.</p>
<p>I could have flung my plate at him to be such an ass, and to
have so little a gift of languages where that was the
essential.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What think ye of that?&rsquo; said the clerk.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is that French enough?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; cried I, leaping up like one who
should suddenly perceive an acquaintance, &lsquo;is this you, Mr.
Dubois?&nbsp; Why, who would have dreamed of encountering you so
far from home?&rsquo;&nbsp; As I spoke, I shook hands with the
Major heartily; and turning to our tormentor, &lsquo;Oh, sir, you
may be perfectly reassured!&nbsp; This is a very honest fellow, a
late neighbour of mine in the city of Carlisle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I thought the attorney looked put out; I little knew the
man!</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he is French,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for all
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, to be sure!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;A Frenchman
of the emigration!&nbsp; None of your Buonaparte lot.&nbsp; I
will warrant his views of politics to be as sound as your
own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is a little strange,&rsquo; said the clerk
quietly, &lsquo;is that Mr. Dubois should deny it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I got it fair in the face, and took it smiling; but the shock
was rude, and in the course of the next words I contrived to do
what I have rarely done, and make a slip in my English.&nbsp; I
kept my liberty and life by my proficiency all these months, and
for once that I failed, it is not to be supposed that I would
make a public exhibition of the details.&nbsp; Enough, that it
was a very little error, and one that might have passed
ninety-nine times in a hundred.&nbsp; But my limb of the law was
as swift to pick it up as though he had been by trade a master of
languages.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; cries he; &lsquo;and you are French,
too!&nbsp; Your tongue bewrays you.&nbsp; Two Frenchmen coming
into an alehouse, severally and accidentally, not knowing each
other, at ten of the clock at night, in the middle of
Bedfordshire?&nbsp; No, sir, that shall not pass!&nbsp; You are
all prisoners escaping, if you are nothing worse.&nbsp; Consider
yourselves under arrest.&nbsp; I have to trouble you for your
papers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is your warrant, if you come to that?&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;My papers!&nbsp; A likely thing that I would show
my papers on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of an unknown fellow in a
hedge alehouse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you resist the law?&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not the law, sir!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope I
am too good a subject for that.&nbsp; But for a nameless fellow
with a bald head and a pair of gingham small-clothes, why
certainly!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my birthright as an Englishman.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s <i>Magna Charta</i>, else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will see about that,&rsquo; says he; and then,
addressing the assistants, &lsquo;where does the constable
live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord love you, sir!&rsquo; cried the landlord,
&lsquo;what are you thinking of?&nbsp; The constable at past ten
at night!&nbsp; Why, he&rsquo;s abed and asleep, and good and
drunk two hours agone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah that a&rsquo; be!&rsquo; came in chorus from the
yokels.</p>
<p>The attorney&rsquo;s clerk was put to a stand.&nbsp; He could
not think of force; there was little sign of martial ardour about
the landlord, and the peasants were indifferent&mdash;they only
listened, and gaped, and now scratched a head, and now would get
a light to their pipes from the embers on the hearth.&nbsp; On
the other hand, the Major and I put a bold front on the business
and defied him, not without some ground of law.&nbsp; In this
state of matters he proposed I should go along with him to one
Squire Merton, a great man of the neighbourhood, who was in the
commission of the peace, the end of his avenue but three lanes
away.&nbsp; I told him I would not stir a foot for him if it were
to save his soul.&nbsp; Next he proposed I should stay all night
where I was, and the constable could see to my affair in the
morning, when he was sober.&nbsp; I replied I should go when and
where I pleased; that we were lawful travellers in the fear of
God and the king, and I for one would suffer myself to be stayed
by nobody.&nbsp; At the same time, I was thinking the matter had
lasted altogether too long, and I determined to bring it to an
end at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See here,&rsquo; said I, getting up, for till now I had
remained carelessly seated, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s only one way to
decide a thing like this&mdash;only one way that&rsquo;s right
<i>English</i>&mdash;and that&rsquo;s man to man.&nbsp; Take off
your coat, sir, and these gentlemen shall see fair
play.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this there came a look in his eye that I
could not mistake.&nbsp; His education had been neglected in one
essential and eminently British particular: he could not
box.&nbsp; No more could I, you may say; but then I had the more
impudence&mdash;and I had made the proposal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He says I&rsquo;m no Englishman, but the proof of the
pudding is the eating of it,&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp; And here I
stripped my coat and fell into the proper attitude, which was
just about all I knew of this barbarian art.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
sir, you seem to me to hang back a little,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll meet you; I&rsquo;ll give you an
appetiser&mdash;though hang me if I can understand the man that
wants any enticement to hold up his hands.&rsquo;&nbsp; I drew a
bank-note out of my fob and tossed it to the landlord.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There are the stakes,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fight you for first blood, since you seem to
make so much work about it.&nbsp; If you tap my claret first,
there are five guineas for you, and I&rsquo;ll go with you to any
squire you choose to mention.&nbsp; If I tap yours, you&rsquo;ll
perhaps let on that I&rsquo;m the better man, and allow me to go
about my lawful business at my own time and convenience, by God;
is that fair, my lads?&rsquo; says I, appealing to the
company.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay,&rsquo; said the chorus of chawbacons; &lsquo;he
can&rsquo;t say no fairer nor that, he can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Take
off thy coat master!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The limb of the law was now on the wrong side of public
opinion, and, what heartened me to go on, the position was
rapidly changing in our favour.&nbsp; Already the Major was
paying his shot to the very indifferent landlord, and I could see
the white face of King at the back-door, making signals of
haste.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; quoth my enemy, &lsquo;you are as full of
doubles as a fox, are you not?&nbsp; But I see through you; I see
through and through you.&nbsp; You would change the venue, would
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may be transparent, sir,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;but if
you&rsquo;ll do me the favour to stand up, you&rsquo;ll find I
can hit dam hard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which is a point, if you will observe, that I had never
called in question,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, you
ignorant clowns,&rsquo; he proceeded, addressing the company,
&lsquo;can&rsquo;t you see the fellow&rsquo;s gulling you before
your eyes?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see that he has changed the
point upon me?&nbsp; I say he&rsquo;s a French prisoner, and he
answers that he can box!&nbsp; What has that to do with it?&nbsp;
I would not wonder but what he can dance, too&mdash;they&rsquo;re
all dancing masters over there.&nbsp; I say, and I stick to it,
that he&rsquo;s a Frenchy.&nbsp; He says he isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Well then, let him out with his papers, if he has them!&nbsp; If
he had, would he not show them?&nbsp; If he had, would he not
jump at the idea of going to Squire Merton, a man you all
know?&nbsp; Now, you are all plain, straightforward Bedfordshire
men, and I wouldn&rsquo;t ask a better lot to appeal to.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re not the kind to be talked over with any French
gammon, and he&rsquo;s plenty of that.&nbsp; But let me tell him,
he can take his pigs to another market; they&rsquo;ll never do
here; they&rsquo;ll never go down in Bedfordshire.&nbsp; Why!
look at the man!&nbsp; Look at his feet!&nbsp; Has anybody got a
foot in the room like that?&nbsp; See how he stands! do any of
you fellows stand like that?&nbsp; Does the landlord,
there?&nbsp; Why, he has Frenchman wrote all over him, as big as
a sign-post!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was all very well; and in a different scene I might even
have been gratified by his remarks; but I saw clearly, if I were
to allow him to talk, he might turn the tables on me
altogether.&nbsp; He might not be much of a hand at boxing; but I
was much mistaken, or he had studied forensic eloquence in a good
school.&nbsp; In this predicament I could think of nothing more
ingenious than to burst out of the house, under the pretext of an
ungovernable rage.&nbsp; It was certainly not very
ingenious&mdash;it was elementary, but I had no choice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You white-livered dog!&rsquo; I broke out.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you dare to tell me you&rsquo;re an Englishman, and
won&rsquo;t fight?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll stand no more of
this!&nbsp; I leave this place, where I&rsquo;ve been
insulted!&nbsp; Here! what&rsquo;s to pay?&nbsp; Pay
yourself!&rsquo; I went on, offering the landlord a handful of
silver, &lsquo;and give me back my bank-note!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The landlord, following his usual policy of obliging
everybody, offered no opposition to my design.&nbsp; The position
of my adversary was now thoroughly bad.&nbsp; He had lost my two
companions.&nbsp; He was on the point of losing me also.&nbsp;
There was plainly no hope of arousing the company to help; and
watching him with a corner of my eye, I saw him hesitate for a
moment.&nbsp; The next, he had taken down his hat and his wig,
which was of black horsehair; and I saw him draw from behind the
settle a vast hooded great-coat and a small valise.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The devil!&rsquo; thought I: &lsquo;is the rascal going to
follow me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was scarce clear of the inn before the limb of the law was
at my heels.&nbsp; I saw his face plain in the moonlight; and the
most resolute purpose showed in it, along with an unmoved
composure.&nbsp; A chill went over me.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is no
common adventure,&rsquo; thinks I to myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have got hold of a man of character, St. Ives!&nbsp; A bite-hard,
a bull-dog, a weasel is on your trail; and how are you to throw
him off?&rsquo;&nbsp; Who was he?&nbsp; By some of his
expressions I judged he was a hanger-on of courts.&nbsp; But in
what character had he followed the assizes?&nbsp; As a simple
spectator, as a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk, as a criminal himself,
or&mdash;last and worst supposition&mdash;as a Bow-street
&lsquo;runner&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The cart would wait for me, perhaps, half a mile down our
onward road, which I was already following.&nbsp; And I told
myself that in a few minutes&rsquo; walking, Bow-street runner or
not, I should have him at my mercy.&nbsp; And then reflection
came to me in time.&nbsp; Of all things, one was out of the
question.&nbsp; Upon no account must this obtrusive fellow see
the cart.&nbsp; Until I had killed or shook him off, I was quite
divorced from my companions&mdash;alone, in the midst of England,
on a frosty by-way leading whither I knew not, with a
sleuth-hound at my heels, and never a friend but the
holly-stick!</p>
<p>We came at the same time to a crossing of lanes.&nbsp; The
branch to the left was overhung with trees, deeply sunken and
dark.&nbsp; Not a ray of moonlight penetrated its recesses; and I
took it at a venture.&nbsp; The wretch followed my example in
silence; and for some time we crunched together over frozen pools
without a word.&nbsp; Then he found his voice, with a
chuckle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is not the way to Mr. Merton&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;It is mine,
however.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And therefore mine,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>Again we fell silent; and we may thus have covered half a mile
before the lane, taking a sudden turn, brought us forth again
into the moonshine.&nbsp; With his hooded great-coat on his back,
his valise in his hand, his black wig adjusted, and footing it on
the ice with a sort of sober doggedness of manner, my enemy was
changed almost beyond recognition: changed in everything but a
certain dry, polemical, pedantic air, that spoke of a sedentary
occupation and high stools.&nbsp; I observed, too, that his
valise was heavy; and, putting this and that together, hit upon a
plan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A seasonable night, sir,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you say to a bit of running?&nbsp; The frost has
me by the toes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all the pleasure in life,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>His voice seemed well assured, which pleased me little.&nbsp;
However, there was nothing else to try, except violence, for
which it would always be too soon.&nbsp; I took to my heels
accordingly, he after me; and for some time the slapping of our
feet on the hard road might have been heard a mile away.&nbsp; He
had started a pace behind me, and he finished in the same
position.&nbsp; For all his extra years and the weight of his
valise, he had not lost a hair&rsquo;s breadth.&nbsp; The devil
might race him for me&mdash;I had enough of it!</p>
<p>And, besides, to run so fast was contrary to my
interests.&nbsp; We could not run long without arriving
somewhere.&nbsp; At any moment we might turn a corner and find
ourselves at the lodge-gate of some Squire Merton, in the midst
of a village whose constable was sober, or in the hands of a
patrol.&nbsp; There was no help for it&mdash;I must finish with
him on the spot, as long as it was possible.&nbsp; I looked about
me, and the place seemed suitable; never a light, never a
house&mdash;nothing but stubble-fields, fallows, and a few
stunted trees.&nbsp; I stopped and eyed him in the moonlight with
an angry stare.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enough of this foolery!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>He had tamed, and now faced me full, very pale, but with no
sign of shrinking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite of your opinion,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You have tried me at the running; you can try me next at
the high jump.&nbsp; It will be all the same.&nbsp; It must end
the one way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I made my holly whistle about my head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you know what way!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We are alone, it is night, and I am wholly resolved.&nbsp;
Are you not frightened?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;not in the smallest.&nbsp; I
do not box, sir; but I am not a coward, as you may have
supposed.&nbsp; Perhaps it will simplify our relations if I tell
you at the outset that I walk armed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Quick as lightning I made a feint at his head; as quickly he
gave ground, and at the same time I saw a pistol glitter in his
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more of that, Mr. French-Prisoner!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will do me no good to have your death at my
door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith, nor me either!&rsquo; said I; and I lowered my
stick and considered the man, not without a twinkle of
admiration.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;there is
one consideration that you appear to overlook: there are a great
many chances that your pistol may miss fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a pair,&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never
travel without a brace of barkers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I make you my compliment,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are able to take care of yourself, and that is a good
trait.&nbsp; But, my good man! let us look at this matter
dispassionately.&nbsp; You are not a coward, and no more am I; we
are both men of excellent sense; I have good reason, whatever it
may be, to keep my concerns to myself and to walk alone.&nbsp;
Now I put it to you pointedly, am I likely to stand it?&nbsp; Am
I likely to put up with your continued and&mdash;excuse
me&mdash;highly impudent <i>ing&eacute;rence</i> into my private
affairs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Another French word,&rsquo; says he composedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! damn your French words!&rsquo; cried I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You seem to be a Frenchman yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have had many opportunities by which I have
profited,&rsquo; he explained.&nbsp; &lsquo;Few men are better
acquainted with the similarities and differences, whether of
idiom or accent, of the two languages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a pompous fellow, too!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I can make distinctions, sir,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I can talk with Bedfordshire peasants; and I can express
myself becomingly, I hope, in the company of a gentleman of
education like yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you set up to be a gentleman&mdash;&rsquo; I
began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; he interrupted: &lsquo;I make no such
claim.&nbsp; I only see the nobility and gentry in the way of
business.&nbsp; I am quite a plain person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; I exclaimed,
&lsquo;set my mind at rest upon one point.&nbsp; In the name of
mystery, who and what are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no cause to be ashamed of my name, sir,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;nor yet my trade.&nbsp; I am Thomas Dudgeon, at
your service, clerk to Mr. Daniel Romaine, solicitor of London;
High Holborn is our address, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was only by the ecstasy of the relief that I knew how
horribly I had been frightened.&nbsp; I flung my stick on the
road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Romaine?&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Daniel
Romaine?&nbsp; An old hunks with a red face and a big head, and
got up like a Quaker?&nbsp; My dear friend, to my
arms!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep back, I say!&rsquo; said Dudgeon weakly.</p>
<p>I would not listen to him.&nbsp; With the end of my own alarm,
I felt as if I must infallibly be at the end of all dangers
likewise; as if the pistol that he held in one hand were no more
to be feared than the valise that he carried with the other, and
now put up like a barrier against my advance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep back, or I declare I will fire,&rsquo; he was
crying.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have a care, for God&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; My
pistol&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He might scream as be pleased.&nbsp; Willy nilly, I folded him
to my breast, I pressed him there, I kissed his ugly mug as it
had never been kissed before and would never be kissed again; and
in the doing so knocked his wig awry and his hat off.&nbsp; He
bleated in my embrace; so bleats the sheep in the arms of the
butcher.&nbsp; The whole thing, on looking back, appears
incomparably reckless and absurd; I no better than a madman for
offering to advance on Dudgeon, and he no better than a fool for
not shooting me while I was about it.&nbsp; But all&rsquo;s well
that ends well; or, as the people in these days kept singing and
whistling on the streets:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a sweet little cherub that
sits up aloft<br />
And looks out for the life of poor Jack.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; said I, releasing him a little, but still
keeping my hands on his shoulders, &lsquo;<i>je vous ai bel et
bien embrass&eacute;</i>&mdash;and, as you would say, there is
another French word.&rsquo;&nbsp; With his wig over one eye, he
looked incredibly rueful and put out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cheer up,
Dudgeon; the ordeal is over, you shall be embraced no more.&nbsp;
But do, first of all, for God&rsquo;s-sake, put away your pistol;
you handle it as if you were a cockatrice; some time or other,
depend upon it, it will certainly go off.&nbsp; Here is your
hat.&nbsp; No, let me put it on square, and the wig before
it.&nbsp; Never suffer any stress of circumstances to come
between you and the duty you owe to yourself.&nbsp; If you have
nobody else to dress for, dress for God!</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Put your wig straight<br />
On your bald pate,<br />
Keep your chin scraped,<br />
And your figure draped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you match me that?&nbsp; The whole duty of man in a
quatrain!&nbsp; And remark, I do not set up to be a professional
bard; these are the outpourings of a
<i>dilettante</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear sir!&rsquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear sir!&rsquo; I echoed, &lsquo;I will allow
no man to interrupt the flow of my ideas.&nbsp; Give me your
opinion on my quatrain, or I vow we shall have a quarrel of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly you are quite an original,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and I believe I have my
counterpart before me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, for a choice,&rsquo; says he, smiling, &lsquo;and
whether for sense or poetry, give me</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Worth makes the man, and want of it
the fellow:<br />
The rest is all but leather and prunello.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s not fair&mdash;that&rsquo;s
Pope!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not original, Dudgeon.&nbsp; Understand
me,&rsquo; said I, wringing his breast-button, &lsquo;the first
duty of all poetry is to be mine, sir&mdash;mine.&nbsp;
Inspiration now swells in my bosom, because&mdash;to tell you the
plain truth, and descend a little in style&mdash;I am devilish
relieved at the turn things have taken.&nbsp; So, I dare say, are
you yourself, Dudgeon, if you would only allow it.&nbsp; And
<i>&agrave; propos</i>, let me ask you a home question.&nbsp;
Between friends, have you ever fired that pistol?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, yes, sir,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Twice&mdash;at hedgesparrows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you would have fired at me, you bloody-minded
man?&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you go to that, you seemed mighty reckless with your
stick,&rsquo; said Dudgeon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I indeed?&nbsp; Well, well, &rsquo;tis all past
history; ancient as King Pharamond&mdash;which is another French
word, if you cared to accumulate more evidence,&rsquo; says
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But happily we are now the best of friends, and
have all our interests in common.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You go a little too fast, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me,
Mr. ---: I do not know your name, that I am aware,&rsquo; said
Dudgeon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, to be sure!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never heard
of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A word of explanation&mdash;&rsquo; he began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Dudgeon!&rsquo; I interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be
practical; I know what you want, and the name of it is
supper.&nbsp; <i>Rien ne creuse comme l&rsquo;emotion</i>.&nbsp;
I am hungry myself, and yet I am more accustomed to warlike
palpitations than you, who are but a hunter of
hedgesparrows.&nbsp; Let me look at your face critically: your
bill of fare is three slices of cold rare roast beef, a Welsh
rabbit, a pot of stout, and a glass or two of sound tawny port,
old in bottle&mdash;the right milk of Englishmen.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Methought there seemed a brightening in his eye and a melting
about his mouth at this enumeration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The night is young,&rsquo; I continued; &lsquo;not much
past eleven, for a wager.&nbsp; Where can we find a good
inn?&nbsp; And remark that I say <i>good</i>, for the port must
be up to the occasion&mdash;not a headache in a pipe of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, sir,&rsquo; he said, smiling a little,
&lsquo;you have a way of carrying things&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will nothing make you stick to the subject?&rsquo; I
cried; &lsquo;you have the most irrelevant mind!&nbsp; How do you
expect to rise in your profession?&nbsp; The inn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I will say you are a facetious gentleman!&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must have your way, I see.&nbsp; We are
not three miles from Bedford by this very road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Done!&rsquo; cried I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bedford be
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I tucked his arm under mine, possessed myself of the valise,
and walked him off unresisting.&nbsp; Presently we came to an
open piece of country lying a thought downhill.&nbsp; The road
was smooth and free of ice, the moonshine thin and bright over
the meadows and the leafless trees.&nbsp; I was now honestly done
with the purgatory of the covered cart; I was close to my
great-uncle&rsquo;s; I had no more fear of Mr. Dudgeon; which
were all grounds enough for jollity.&nbsp; And I was aware,
besides, of us two as of a pair of tiny and solitary dolls under
the vast frosty cupola of the midnight; the rooms decked, the
moon burnished, the least of the stars lighted, the floor swept
and waxed, and nothing wanting but for the band to strike up and
the dancing to begin.&nbsp; In the exhilaration of my heart I
took the music on myself&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Merrily danced the Quaker&rsquo;s wife,<br
/>
And merrily danced the Quaker.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I broke into that animated and appropriate air, clapped my arm
about Dudgeon&rsquo;s waist, and away down the hill at a dancing
step!&nbsp; He hung back a little at the start, but the impulse
of the tune, the night, and my example, were not to be
resisted.&nbsp; A man made of putty must have danced, and even
Dudgeon showed himself to be a human being.&nbsp; Higher and
higher were the capers that we cut; the moon repeated in shadow
our antic footsteps and gestures; and it came over my mind of a
sudden&mdash;really like balm&mdash;what appearance of man I was
dancing with, what a long bilious countenance he had shown under
his shaven pate, and what a world of trouble the rascal had given
me in the immediate past.</p>
<p>Presently we began to see the lights of Bedford.&nbsp; My
Puritanic companion stopped and disengaged himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a trifle <i>infra dig.</i>, sir, is it
not?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;A party might suppose we had
been drinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so you shall be, Dudgeon,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You shall not only be drinking, you old hypocrite, but you
shall be drunk&mdash;dead drunk, sir&mdash;and the boots shall
put you to bed!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll warn him when we go in.&nbsp;
Never neglect a precaution; never put off till to-morrow what you
can do to-day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he had no more frivolity to complain of.&nbsp; We finished
our stage and came to the inn-door with decorum, to find the
house still alight and in a bustle with many late arrivals; to
give our orders with a prompt severity which ensured obedience,
and to be served soon after at a side-table, close to the fire
and in a blaze of candle-light, with such a meal as I had been
dreaming of for days past.&nbsp; For days, you are to remember, I
had been skulking in the covered cart, a prey to cold, hunger,
and an accumulation of discomforts that might have daunted the
most brave; and the white table napery, the bright crystal, the
reverberation of the fire, the red curtains, the Turkey carpet,
the portraits on the coffee-room wall, the placid faces of the
two or three late guests who were silently prolonging the
pleasures of digestion, and (last, but not by any means least) a
glass of an excellent light dry port, put me in a humour only to
be described as heavenly.&nbsp; The thought of the Colonel, of
how he would have enjoyed this snug room and roaring fire, and of
his cold grave in the wood by Market Bosworth, lingered on my
palate, <i>amari aliquid</i>, like an after-taste, but was not
able&mdash;I say it with shame&mdash;entirely to dispel my
self-complacency.&nbsp; After all, in this world every dog hangs
by its own tail.&nbsp; I was a free adventurer, who had just
brought to a successful end&mdash;or, at least, within view of
it&mdash;an adventure very difficult and alarming; and I looked
across at Mr. Dudgeon, as the port rose to his cheeks, and a
smile, that was semi-confidential and a trifle foolish, began to
play upon his leathery features, not only with composure, but
with a suspicion of kindness.&nbsp; The rascal had been brave, a
quality for which I would value the devil; and if he had been
pertinacious in the beginning, he had more than made up for it
before the end.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, Dudgeon, to explain,&rsquo; I began.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I know your master, he knows me, and he knows and approves
of my errand.&nbsp; So much I may tell you, that I am on my way
to Amersham Place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; quoth Dudgeon, &lsquo;I begin to
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am heartily glad of it,&rsquo; said I, passing the
bottle, &lsquo;because that is about all I can tell you.&nbsp;
You must take my word for the remainder.&nbsp; Either believe me
or don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, let&rsquo;s take a
chaise; you can carry me to-morrow to High Holborn, and confront
me with Mr. Romaine; the result of which will be to set your mind
at rest&mdash;and to make the holiest disorder in your
master&rsquo;s plans.&nbsp; If I judge you aright (for I find you
a shrewd fellow), this will not be at all to your mind.&nbsp; You
know what a subordinate gets by officiousness; if I can trust my
memory, old Romaine has not at all the face that I should care to
see in anger; and I venture to predict surprising results upon
your weekly salary&mdash;if you are paid by the week, that
is.&nbsp; In short, let me go free, and &rsquo;tis an end of the
matter; take me to London, and &rsquo;tis only a
beginning&mdash;and, by my opinion, a beginning of
troubles.&nbsp; You can take your choice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that is soon taken,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go
to Amersham tomorrow, or go to the devil if you prefer&mdash;I
wash my hands of you and the whole transaction.&nbsp; No, you
don&rsquo;t find me putting my head in between Romaine and a
client!&nbsp; A good man of business, sir, but hard as millstone
grit.&nbsp; I might get the sack, and I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder!&nbsp; But, it&rsquo;s a pity, too,&rsquo; he added, and
sighed, shook his head, and took his glass off sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That reminds me,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a
great curiosity, and you can satisfy it.&nbsp; Why were you so
forward to meddle with poor Mr. Dubois?&nbsp; Why did you
transfer your attentions to me?&nbsp; And generally, what induced
you to make yourself such a nuisance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He blushed deeply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;there is such a thing
as patriotism, I hope.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;THE HOME-COMING OF MR. ROWLEY&rsquo;S
VISCOUNT</h2>
<p>By eight the next morning Dudgeon and I had made our
parting.&nbsp; By that time we had grown to be extremely
familiar; and I would very willingly have kept him by me, and
even carried him to Amersham Place.&nbsp; But it appeared he was
due at the public-house where we had met, on some affairs of my
great-uncle the Count, who had an outlying estate in that part of
the shire.&nbsp; If Dudgeon had had his way the night before, I
should have been arrested on my uncle&rsquo;s land and by my
uncle&rsquo;s agent, a culmination of ill-luck.</p>
<p>A little after noon I started, in a hired chaise, by way of
Dunstable.&nbsp; The mere mention of the name Amersham Place made
every one supple and smiling.&nbsp; It was plainly a great house,
and my uncle lived there in style.&nbsp; The fame of it rose as
we approached, like a chain of mountains; at Bedford they touched
their caps, but in Dunstable they crawled upon their
bellies.&nbsp; I thought the landlady would have kissed me; such
a flutter of cordiality, such smiles, such affectionate
attentions were called forth, and the good lady bustled on my
service in such a pother of ringlets and with such a jingling of
keys.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re probably expected, sir, at the
Place?&nbsp; I do trust you may &rsquo;ave better accounts of his
lordship&rsquo;s &rsquo;elth, sir.&nbsp; We understood that his
lordship, Mosha de Carwell, was main bad.&nbsp; Ha, sir, we shall
all feel his loss, poor, dear, noble gentleman; and I&rsquo;m
sure nobody more polite!&nbsp; They do say, sir, his wealth is
enormous, and before the Revolution, quite a prince in his own
country!&nbsp; But I beg your pardon, sir; &rsquo;ow I do run on,
to be sure; and doubtless all beknown to you already!&nbsp; For
you do resemble the family, sir.&nbsp; I should have known you
anywheres by the likeness to the dear viscount.&nbsp; Ha, poor
gentleman, he must &rsquo;ave a &rsquo;eavy &rsquo;eart these
days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the same place I saw out of the inn-windows a man-servant
passing in the livery of my house, which you are to think I had
never before seen worn, or not that I could remember.&nbsp; I had
often enough, indeed, pictured myself advanced to be a Marshal, a
Duke of the Empire, a Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, and
some other kickshaws of the kind, with a perfect rout of flunkeys
correctly dressed in my own colours.&nbsp; But it is one thing to
imagine, and another to see; it would be one thing to have these
liveries in a house of my own in Paris&mdash;it was quite another
to find them flaunting in the heart of hostile England; and I
fear I should have made a fool of myself, if the man had not been
on the other side of the street, and I at a one-pane
window.&nbsp; There was something illusory in this
transplantation of the wealth and honours of a family, a thing by
its nature so deeply rooted in the soil; something ghostly in
this sense of home-coming so far from home.</p>
<p>From Dunstable I rolled away into a crescendo of similar
impressions.&nbsp; There are certainly few things to be compared
with these castles, or rather country seats, of the English
nobility and gentry; nor anything at all to equal the servility
of the population that dwells in their neighbourhood.&nbsp;
Though I was but driving in a hired chaise, word of my
destination seemed to have gone abroad, and the women curtseyed
and the men louted to me by the wayside.&nbsp; As I came near, I
began to appreciate the roots of this widespread respect.&nbsp;
The look of my uncle&rsquo;s park wall, even from the outside,
had something of a princely character; and when I came in view of
the house itself, a sort of madness of vicarious vain-glory
struck me dumb and kept me staring.&nbsp; It was about the size
of the Tuileries.&nbsp; It faced due north; and the last rays of
the sun, that was setting like a red-hot shot amidst a tumultuous
gathering of snow clouds, were reflected on the endless rows of
windows.&nbsp; A portico of Doric columns adorned the front, and
would have done honour to a temple.&nbsp; The servant who
received me at the door was civil to a fault&mdash;I had almost
said, to offence; and the hall to which he admitted me through a
pair of glass doors was warmed and already partly lighted by a
liberal chimney heaped with the roots of beeches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vicomte Anne de St. Yves,&rsquo; said I, in answer to
the man&rsquo;s question; whereupon he bowed before me lower
still, and stepping upon one side introduced me to the truly
awful presence of the major-domo.&nbsp; I have seen many
dignitaries in my time, but none who quite equalled this eminent
being; who was good enough to answer to the unassuming name of
Dawson.&nbsp; From him I learned that my uncle was extremely low,
a doctor in close attendance, Mr. Romaine expected at any moment,
and that my cousin, the Vicomte de St. Yves, had been sent for
the same morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a sudden seizure, then?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Well, he would scarcely go as far as that.&nbsp; It was a
decline, a fading away, sir; but he was certainly took bad the
day before, had sent for Mr. Romaine, and the major-domo had
taken it on himself a little later to send word to the
Viscount.&nbsp; &lsquo;It seemed to me, my lord,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;as if this was a time when all the fambly should be called
together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I approved him with my lips, but not in my heart.&nbsp; Dawson
was plainly in the interests of my cousin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when can I expect to see my great-uncle, the
Count?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>In the evening, I was told; in the meantime he would show me
to my room, which had been long prepared for me, and I should be
expected to dine in about an hour with the doctor, if my lordship
had no objections.</p>
<p>My lordship had not the faintest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the same time,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I have had an
accident: I have unhappily lost my baggage, and am here in what I
stand in.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if the doctor be a formalist,
but it is quite impossible I should appear at table as I
ought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He begged me to be under no anxiety.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have been
long expecting you,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;All is
ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such I found to be the truth.&nbsp; A great room had been
prepared for me; through the mullioned windows the last flicker
of the winter sunset interchanged with the reverberation of a
royal fire; the bed was open, a suit of evening clothes was
airing before the blaze, and from the far corner a boy came
forward with deprecatory smiles.&nbsp; The dream in which I had
been moving seemed to have reached its pitch.&nbsp; I might have
quitted this house and room only the night before; it was my own
place that I had come to; and for the first time in my life I
understood the force of the words home and welcome.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This will be all as you would want, sir?&rsquo; said
Mr. Dawson.&nbsp; &lsquo;This &rsquo;ere boy, Rowley, we place
entirely at your disposition.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s not exactly
a trained vallet, but Mossho Powl, the Viscount&rsquo;s
gentleman, &rsquo;ave give him the benefick of a few lessons, and
it is &rsquo;oped that he may give sitisfection.&nbsp; Hanythink
that you may require, if you will be so good as to mention the
same to Rowley, I will make it my business myself, sir, to see
you sitisfied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the eminent and already detested Mr. Dawson took
his departure, and I was left alone with Rowley.&nbsp; A man who
may be said to have wakened to consciousness in the prison of the
Abbaye, among those ever graceful and ever tragic figures of the
brave and fair, awaiting the hour of the guillotine and denuded
of every comfort, I had never known the luxuries or the amenities
of my rank in life.&nbsp; To be attended on by servants I had
only been accustomed to in inns.&nbsp; My toilet had long been
military, to a moment, at the note of a bugle, too often at a
ditch-side.&nbsp; And it need not be wondered at if I looked on
my new valet with a certain diffidence.&nbsp; But I remembered
that if he was my first experience of a valet, I was his first
trial as a master.&nbsp; Cheered by which consideration, I
demanded my bath in a style of good assurance.&nbsp; There was a
bathroom contiguous; in an incredibly short space of time the hot
water was ready; and soon after, arrayed in a shawl
dressing-gown, and in a luxury of contentment and comfort, I was
reclined in an easy-chair before the mirror, while Rowley, with a
mixture of pride and anxiety which I could well understand, laid
out his razors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey, Rowley?&rsquo; I asked, not quite resigned to go
under fire with such an inexperienced commander.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, is it?&nbsp; You feel pretty sure of
your weapons?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my lord,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, I assure your lordship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Rowley, &lsquo;but for the sake
of shortness, would you mind not belording me in private?&rsquo;
said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will do very well if you call me Mr.
Anne.&nbsp; It is the way of my country, as I dare say you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rowley looked blank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you&rsquo;re just as much a Viscount as Mr.
Powl&rsquo;s, are you not?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As Mr. Powl&rsquo;s Viscount?&rsquo; said I,
laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, keep your mind easy, Mr.
Rowley&rsquo;s is every bit as good.&nbsp; Only, you see, as I am
of the younger line, I bear my Christian name along with the
title.&nbsp; Alain is the <i>Viscount</i>; I am the <i>Viscount
Anne</i>.&nbsp; And in giving me the name of Mr. Anne, I assure
you you will be quite regular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mr. Anne,&rsquo; said the docile youth.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But about the shaving, sir, you need be under no
alarm.&nbsp; Mr. Powl says I &rsquo;ave excellent
dispositions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Powl?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
doesn&rsquo;t seem to me very like a French name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, indeed, my lord,&rsquo; said he, with a burst
of confidence.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, indeed, Mr. Anne, and it do not
surely.&nbsp; I should say now, it was more like Mr.
Pole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Mr. Powl is the Viscount&rsquo;s man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mr. Anne,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
&rsquo;ave a hard billet, he do.&nbsp; The Viscount is a very
particular gentleman.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think as you&rsquo;ll
be, Mr. Anne?&rsquo; he added, with a confidential smile in the
mirror.</p>
<p>He was about sixteen, well set up, with a pleasant, merry,
freckled face, and a pair of dancing eyes.&nbsp; There was an air
at once deprecatory and insinuating about the rascal that I
thought I recognised.&nbsp; There came to me from my own boyhood
memories of certain passionate admirations long passed away, and
the objects of them long ago discredited or dead.&nbsp; I
remembered how anxious I had been to serve those fleeting heroes,
how readily I told myself I would have died for <i>them</i>, how
much greater and handsomer than life they had appeared.&nbsp; And
looking in the mirror, it seemed to me that I read the face of
Rowley, like an echo or a ghost, by the light of my own
youth.&nbsp; I have always contended (somewhat against the
opinion of my friends) that I am first of all an economist; and
the last thing that I would care to throw away is that very
valuable piece of property&mdash;a boy&rsquo;s hero-worship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you shave like an angel, Mr.
Rowley!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, my lord,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Powl had no fear of me. You may be sure, sir, I should never
&rsquo;ave had this berth if I &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave been
up to Dick.&nbsp; We been expecting of you this month back.&nbsp;
My eye!&nbsp; I never see such preparations.&nbsp; Every day the
fires has been kep&rsquo; up, the bed made, and all!&nbsp; As
soon as it was known you were coming, sir, I got the appointment;
and I&rsquo;ve been up and down since then like a
Jack-in-the-box.&nbsp; A wheel couldn&rsquo;t sound in the avenue
but what I was at the window!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a many
disappointments; but to-night, as soon as you stepped out of the
shay, I knew it was my&mdash;it was you.&nbsp; Oh, you had been
expected!&nbsp; Why, when I go down to supper, I&rsquo;ll be the
&rsquo;ero of the servants&rsquo; &rsquo;all: the &rsquo;ole of
the staff is that curious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I hope you may be able to
give a fair account of me&mdash;sober, steady, industrious,
good-tempered, and with a first-rate character from my last
place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed an embarrassed laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your hair curls
beautiful,&rsquo; he said, by way of changing the subject.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Viscount&rsquo;s the boy for curls, though; and the
richness of it is, Mr. Powl tells me his don&rsquo;t curl no more
than that much twine&mdash;by nature.&nbsp; Gettin&rsquo; old,
the Viscount is.&nbsp; He &rsquo;<i>ave</i> gone the pace,
&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t &rsquo;e, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that I know very
little about him.&nbsp; Our family has been much divided, and I
have been a soldier from a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A soldier, Mr. Anne, sir?&rsquo; cried Rowley, with a
sudden feverish animation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was you ever
wounded?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is contrary to my principles to discourage admiration for
myself; and, slipping back the shoulder of the dressing-gown, I
silently exhibited the scar which I had received in Edinburgh
Castle.&nbsp; He looked at it with awe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well!&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
where the difference comes in!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s in the
training.&nbsp; The other Viscount have been horse-racing, and
dicing, and carrying on all his life.&nbsp; All right enough, no
doubt; but what I do say is, that it don&rsquo;t lead to
nothink.&nbsp; Whereas&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whereas Mr. Rowley&rsquo;s?&rsquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Viscount?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, sir, I
<i>did</i> say it; and now that I&rsquo;ve seen you, I say it
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I could not refrain from smiling at this outburst, and the
rascal caught me in the mirror and smiled to me again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d say it again, Mr. Hanne,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know which side my bread&rsquo;s
buttered.&nbsp; I know when a gen&rsquo;leman&rsquo;s a
gen&rsquo;leman.&nbsp; Mr. Powl can go to Putney with his
one!&nbsp; Beg your pardon, Mr. Anne, for being so
familiar,&rsquo; said he, blushing suddenly scarlet.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was especially warned against it by Mr. Powl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Discipline before all,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Follow your front-rank man.</p>
<p>With that, we began to turn our attention to the
clothes.&nbsp; I was amazed to find them fit so well: not
<i>&agrave; la diable</i>, in the haphazard manner of a
soldier&rsquo;s uniform or a ready-made suit; but with nicety, as
a trained artist might rejoice to make them for a favourite
subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis extraordinary,&rsquo; cried I: &lsquo;these
things fit me perfectly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Mr. Anne, you two be very much of a
shape,&rsquo; said Rowley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&nbsp; What two?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Viscount,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damnation!&nbsp; Have I the man&rsquo;s clothes on me,
too?&rsquo; cried I.</p>
<p>But Rowley hastened to reassure me.&nbsp; On the first word of
my coming, the Count had put the matter of my wardrobe in the
hands of his own and my cousin&rsquo;s tailors; and on the rumour
of our resemblance, my clothes had been made to Alain&rsquo;s
measure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But they were all made for you express, Mr. Anne.&nbsp;
You may be certain the Count would never do nothing by
&rsquo;alf: fires kep&rsquo; burning; the finest of clothes
ordered, I&rsquo;m sure, and a body-servant being trained
a-purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a good fire, and
a good set-out of clothes; and what a valet, Mr. Rowley!&nbsp;
And there&rsquo;s one thing to be said for my cousin&mdash;I mean
for Mr. Powl&rsquo;s Viscount&mdash;he has a very fair
figure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you be took in, Mr. Anne,&rsquo; quoth
the faithless Rowley: &lsquo;he has to be hyked into a pair of
stays to get them things on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, Mr. Rowley,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;this is
telling tales out of school!&nbsp; Do not you be deceived.&nbsp;
The greatest men of antiquity, including Caesar and Hannibal and
Pope Joan, may have been very glad, at my time of life or
Alain&rsquo;s, to follow his example.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
misfortune common to all; and really,&rsquo; said I, bowing to
myself before the mirror like one who should dance the minuet,
&lsquo;when the result is so successful as this, who would do
anything but applaud?&rsquo;</p>
<p>My toilet concluded, I marched on to fresh surprises.&nbsp; My
chamber, my new valet and my new clothes had been beyond hope:
the dinner, the soup, the whole bill of fare was a revelation of
the powers there are in man.&nbsp; I had not supposed it lay in
the genius of any cook to create, out of common beef and mutton,
things so different and dainty.&nbsp; The wine was of a piece,
the doctor a most agreeable companion; nor could I help
reflecting on the prospect that all this wealth, comfort and
handsome profusion might still very possibly become mine.&nbsp;
Here were a change indeed, from the common soldier and the camp
kettle, the prisoner and his prison rations, the fugitive and the
horrors of the covered cart!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THE DESPATCH-BOX</h2>
<p>The doctor had scarce finished his meal before he hastened
with an apology to attend upon his patient; and almost
immediately after I was myself summoned and ushered up the great
staircase and along interminable corridors to the bedside of my
great-uncle the Count.&nbsp; You are to think that up to the
present moment I had not set eyes on this formidable personage,
only on the evidences of his wealth and kindness.&nbsp; You are
to think besides that I had heard him miscalled and abused from
my earliest childhood up.&nbsp; The first of the
<i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> could never expect a good word in
the society in which my father moved.&nbsp; Even yet the reports
I received were of a doubtful nature; even Romaine had drawn of
him no very amiable portrait; and as I was ushered into the room,
it was a critical eye that I cast on my great-uncle.&nbsp; He lay
propped on pillows in a little cot no greater than a camp-bed,
not visibly breathing.&nbsp; He was about eighty years of age,
and looked it; not that his face was much lined, but all the
blood and colour seemed to have faded from his body, and even his
eyes, which last he kept usually closed as though the light
distressed him.&nbsp; There was an unspeakable degree of slyness
in his expression, which kept me ill at ease; he seemed to lie
there with his arms folded, like a spider waiting for prey.&nbsp;
His speech was very deliberate and courteous, but scarce louder
than a sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I bid you welcome, <i>Monsieur le Vicomte
Anne</i>,&rsquo; said he, looking at me hard with his pale eyes,
but not moving on his pillows.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have sent for you,
and I thank you for the obliging expedition you have shown.&nbsp;
It is my misfortune that I cannot rise to receive you.&nbsp; I
trust you have been reasonably well entertained?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Monsieur mon oncle</i>,&rsquo; I said, bowing very
low, &lsquo;I am come at the summons of the head of my
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be
seated.&nbsp; I should be glad to hear some news&mdash;if that
can be called news that is already twenty years old&mdash;of how
I have the pleasure to see you here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By the coldness of his address, not more than by the nature of
the times that he bade me recall, I was plunged in
melancholy.&nbsp; I felt myself surrounded as with deserts of
friendlessness, and the delight of my welcome was turned to ashes
in my mouth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is soon told, <i>monseigneur</i>,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I understand that I need tell you nothing of the
end of my unhappy parents?&nbsp; It is only the story of the lost
dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are right.&nbsp; I am sufficiently informed of that
deplorable affair; it is painful to me.&nbsp; My nephew, your
father, was a man who would not be advised,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tell me, if you please, simply of yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid I must run the risk of harrowing your
sensibility in the beginning,&rsquo; said I, with a bitter smile,
&lsquo;because my story begins at the foot of the
guillotine.&nbsp; When the list came out that night, and her name
was there, I was already old enough, not in years but in sad
experience, to understand the extent of my misfortune.&nbsp;
She&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; I paused.&nbsp; &lsquo;Enough that she
arranged with a friend, Madame de Chasserades, that she should
take charge of me, and by the favour of our jailers I was
suffered to remain in the shelter of the <i>Abbaye</i>.&nbsp;
That was my only refuge; there was no corner of France that I
could rest the sole of my foot upon except the prison.&nbsp;
Monsieur le Comte, you are as well aware as I can be what kind of
a life that was, and how swiftly death smote in that
society.&nbsp; I did not wait long before the name of Madame de
Chasserades succeeded to that of my mother on the list.&nbsp; She
passed me on to Madame de Noytot; she, in her turn, to
Mademoiselle de Braye; and there were others.&nbsp; I was the one
thing permanent; they were all transient as clouds; a day or two
of their care, and then came the last farewell
and&mdash;somewhere far off in that roaring Paris that surrounded
us&mdash;the bloody scene.&nbsp; I was the cherished one, the
last comfort, of these dying women.&nbsp; I have been in pitched
fights, my lord, and I never knew such courage.&nbsp; It was all
done smiling, in the tone of good society; <i>belle maman</i> was
the name I was taught to give to each; and for a day or two the
new &ldquo;pretty mamma&rdquo; would make much of me, show me
off, teach me the minuet, and to say my prayers; and then, with a
tender embrace, would go the way of her predecessors,
smiling.&nbsp; There were some that wept too.&nbsp; There was a
childhood!&nbsp; All the time Monsieur de Culemberg kept his eye
on me, and would have had me out of the <i>Abbaye</i> and in his
own protection, but my &ldquo;pretty mammas&rdquo; one after
another resisted the idea.&nbsp; Where could I be safer? they
argued; and what was to become of them without the darling of the
prison?&nbsp; Well, it was soon shown how safe I was!&nbsp; The
dreadful day of the massacre came; the prison was overrun; none
paid attention to me, not even the last of my &ldquo;pretty
mammas,&rdquo; for she had met another fate.&nbsp; I was
wandering distracted, when I was found by some one in the
interests of Monsieur de Culemberg.&nbsp; I understand he was
sent on purpose; I believe, in order to reach the interior of the
prison, he had set his hand to nameless barbarities: such was the
price paid for my worthless, whimpering little life!&nbsp; He
gave me his hand; it was wet, and mine was reddened; he led me
unresisting.&nbsp; I remember but the one circumstance of my
flight&mdash;it was my last view of my last pretty mamma.&nbsp;
Shall I describe it to you?&rsquo; I asked the Count, with a
sudden fierceness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Avoid unpleasant details,&rsquo; observed my
great-uncle gently.</p>
<p>At these words a sudden peace fell upon me.&nbsp; I had been
angry with the man before; I had not sought to spare him; and
now, in a moment, I saw that there was nothing to spare.&nbsp;
Whether from natural heartlessness or extreme old age, the soul
was not at home; and my benefactor, who had kept the fire lit in
my room for a month past&mdash;my only relative except Alain,
whom I knew already to be a hired spy&mdash;had trodden out the
last sparks of hope and interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and, indeed, the day
for them is nearly over.&nbsp; I was taken to Monsieur de
Culemberg&rsquo;s,&mdash;I presume, sir, that you know the Abbe
de Culemberg?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He indicated assent without opening his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was a very brave and a very learned
man&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a very holy one,&rsquo; said my uncle civilly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a very holy one, as you observe,&rsquo; I
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;He did an infinity of good, and through
all the Terror kept himself from the guillotine.&nbsp; He brought
me up, and gave me such education as I have.&nbsp; It was in his
house in the country at Dammarie, near Melun, that I made the
acquaintance of your agent, Mr. Vicary, who lay there in hiding,
only to fall a victim at the last to a gang of
<i>chauffeurs</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That poor Mr. Vicary!&rsquo; observed my uncle.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He had been many times in my interests to France, and this
was his first failure.&nbsp; <i>Quel charmant homme</i>,
<i>n&rsquo;est-ce pas</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Infinitely so,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I would
not willingly detain you any further with a story, the details of
which it must naturally be more or less unpleasant for you to
hear.&nbsp; Suffice it that, by M. de Culemberg&rsquo;s own
advice, I said farewell at eighteen to that kind preceptor and
his books, and entered the service of France; and have since then
carried arms in such a manner as not to disgrace my
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You narrate well; <i>vous aves la voix
chaude</i>,&rsquo; said my uncle, turning on his pillows as if to
study me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a very good account of you by
Monsieur de Mauseant, whom you helped in Spain.&nbsp; And you had
some education from the Abbe de Culemberg, a man of a good
house?&nbsp; Yes, you will do very well.&nbsp; You have a good
manner and a handsome person, which hurts nothing.&nbsp; We are
all handsome in the family; even I myself, I have had my
successes, the memories of which still charm me.&nbsp; It is my
intention, my nephew, to make of you my heir.&nbsp; I am not very
well content with my other nephew, Monsieur le Vicomte: he has
not been respectful, which is the flattery due to age.&nbsp; And
there are other matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was half tempted to throw back in his face that inheritance
so coldly offered.&nbsp; At the same time I had to consider that
he was an old man, and, after all, my relation; and that I was a
poor one, in considerable straits, with a hope at heart which
that inheritance might yet enable me to realise.&nbsp; Nor could
I forget that, however icy his manners, he had behaved to me from
the first with the extreme of liberality and&mdash;I was about to
write, kindness, but the word, in that connection, would not
come.&nbsp; I really owed the man some measure of gratitude,
which it would be an ill manner to repay if I were to insult him
on his deathbed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your will, monsieur, must ever be my rule,&rsquo; said
I, bowing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have wit, <i>monsieur mon neveu</i>,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;the best wit&mdash;the wit of silence.&nbsp; Many
might have deafened me with their gratitude.&nbsp;
Gratitude!&rsquo; he repeated, with a peculiar intonation, and
lay and smiled to himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;But to approach what is
more important.&nbsp; As a prisoner of war, will it be possible
for you to be served heir to English estates?&nbsp; I have no
idea: long as I have dwelt in England, I have never studied what
they call their laws.&nbsp; On the other hand, how if Romaine
should come too late?&nbsp; I have two pieces of business to be
transacted&mdash;to die, and to make my will; and, however
desirous I may be to serve you, I cannot postpone the first in
favour of the second beyond a very few hours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, I must then contrive to be doing as I did
before,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so,&rsquo; said the Count.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have an
alternative.&nbsp; I have just drawn my balance at my
banker&rsquo;s, a considerable sum, and I am now to place it in
your hands.&nbsp; It will be so much for you and so much
less&mdash;&rsquo; he paused, and smiled with an air of malignity
that surprised me.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it is necessary it should be
done before witnesses.&nbsp; <i>Monsieur le Vicomte</i> is of a
particular disposition, and an unwitnessed donation may very
easily be twisted into a theft.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He touched a bell, which was answered by a man having the
appearance of a confidential valet.&nbsp; To him he gave a
key.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring me the despatch-box that came yesterday, La
Ferriere,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will at the same time
present my compliments to Dr. Hunter and M. l&rsquo;Abbe, and
request them to step for a few moments to my room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The despatch-box proved to be rather a bulky piece of baggage,
covered with Russia leather.&nbsp; Before the doctor and an
excellent old smiling priest it was passed over into my hands
with a very clear statement of the disposer&rsquo;s wishes;
immediately after which, though the witnesses remained behind to
draw up and sign a joint note of the transaction, Monsieur de
K&eacute;roual dismissed me to my own room, La Ferriere following
with the invaluable box.</p>
<p>At my chamber door I took it from him with thanks, and entered
alone.&nbsp; Everything had been already disposed for the night,
the curtains drawn and the fire trimmed; and Rowley was still
busy with my bedclothes.&nbsp; He turned round as I entered with
a look of welcome that did my heart good.&nbsp; Indeed, I had
never a much greater need of human sympathy, however trivial,
than at that moment when I held a fortune in my arms.&nbsp; In my
uncle&rsquo;s room I had breathed the very atmosphere of
disenchantment.&nbsp; He had gorged my pockets; he had starved
every dignified or affectionate sentiment of a man.&nbsp; I had
received so chilling an impression of age and experience that the
mere look of youth drew me to confide in Rowley: he was only a
boy, his heart must beat yet, he must still retain some innocence
and natural feelings, he could blurt out follies with his mouth,
he was not a machine to utter perfect speech!&nbsp; At the same
time, I was beginning to outgrow the painful impressions of my
interview; my spirits were beginning to revive; and at the jolly,
empty looks of Mr. Rowley, as he ran forward to relieve me of the
box, St. Ives became himself again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Rowley, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a momentous juncture.&nbsp; Man and boy,
you have been in my service about three hours.&nbsp; You must
already have observed that I am a gentleman of a somewhat morose
disposition, and there is nothing that I more dislike than the
smallest appearance of familiarity.&nbsp; Mr. Pole or Mr. Powl,
probably in the spirit of prophecy, warned you against this
danger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mr. Anne,&rsquo; said Rowley blankly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now there has just arisen one of those rare cases, in
which I am willing to depart from my principles.&nbsp; My uncle
has given me a box&mdash;what you would call a Christmas
box.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in it, and no more do
you: perhaps I am an April fool, or perhaps I am already
enormously wealthy; there might be five hundred pounds in this
apparently harmless receptacle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord, Mr. Anne!&rsquo; cried Rowley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Rowley, hold up your right hand and repeat the
words of the oath after me,&rsquo; said I, laying the
despatch-box on the table.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strike me blue if I ever
disclose to Mr. Powl, or Mr. Powl&rsquo;s Viscount, or anything
that is Mr. Powl&rsquo;s, not to mention Mr. Dawson and the
doctor, the treasures of the following despatch-box; and strike
me sky-blue scarlet if I do not continually maintain, uphold,
love, honour and obey, serve, and follow to the four corners of
the earth and the waters that are under the earth, the
hereinafter before-mentioned (only that I find I have neglected
to mention him) Viscount Anne de K&eacute;roual de St.-Yves,
commonly known as Mr. Rowley&rsquo;s Viscount.&nbsp; So be
it.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took the oath with the same exaggerated seriousness as I
gave it to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here is the key for
you; I will hold the lid with both hands in the
meanwhile.&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned the key.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bring up
all the candles in the room, and range them along-side.&nbsp;
What is it to be?&nbsp; A live gorgon, a Jack-in-the-box, or a
spring that fires a pistol?&nbsp; On your knees, sir, before the
prodigy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying, I turned the despatch-box upside down upon the
table.&nbsp; At sight of the heap of bank paper and gold that lay
in front of us, between the candles, or rolled upon the floor
alongside, I stood astonished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Lord!&rsquo; cried Mr. Rowley; &lsquo;oh Lordy,
Lordy, Lord!&rsquo; and he scrambled after the fallen
guineas.&nbsp; &lsquo;O my, Mr. Anne! what a sight o&rsquo;
money!&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s like a blessed story-book.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s like the Forty Thieves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now Rowley, let&rsquo;s be cool, let&rsquo;s be
businesslike,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Riches are deceitful,
particularly when you haven&rsquo;t counted them; and the first
thing we have to do is to arrive at the amount of my&mdash;let me
say, modest competency.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, I have
enough here to keep you in gold buttons all the rest of your
life.&nbsp; You collect the gold, and I&rsquo;ll take the
paper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, down we sat together on the hearthrug, and for
some time there was no sound but the creasing of bills and the
jingling of guineas, broken occasionally by the exulting
exclamations of Rowley.&nbsp; The arithmetical operation on which
we were embarked took long, and it might have been tedious to
others; not to me nor to my helper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten thousand pounds!&rsquo; I announced at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten thousand!&rsquo; echoed Mr. Rowley.</p>
<p>And we gazed upon each other.</p>
<p>The greatness of this fortune took my breath away.&nbsp; With
that sum in my hands, I need fear no enemies.&nbsp; People are
arrested, in nine cases out of ten, not because the police are
astute, but because they themselves run short of money; and I had
here before me in the despatch-box a succession of devices and
disguises that insured my liberty.&nbsp; Not only so; but, as I
felt with a sudden and overpowering thrill, with ten thousand
pounds in my hands I was become an eligible suitor.&nbsp; What
advances I had made in the past, as a private soldier in a
military prison, or a fugitive by the wayside, could only be
qualified or, indeed, excused as acts of desperation.&nbsp; And
now, I might come in by the front door; I might approach the
dragon with a lawyer at my elbow, and rich settlements to
offer.&nbsp; The poor French prisoner, Champdivers, might be in a
perpetual danger of arrest; but the rich travelling Englishman,
St.-Ives, in his post-chaise, with his despatch-box by his side,
could smile at fate and laugh at locksmiths.&nbsp; I repeated the
proverb, exulting, <i>Love laughs at locksmiths</i>!&nbsp; In a
moment, by the mere coming of this money, my love had become
possible&mdash;it had come near, it was under my hand&mdash;and
it may be by one of the curiosities of human nature, but it
burned that instant brighter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rowley,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;your Viscount is a made
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, we both are, sir,&rsquo; said Rowley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, both,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and you shall dance at
the wedding;&rsquo; and I flung at his head a bundle of bank
notes, and had just followed it up with a handful of guineas,
when the door opened, and Mr. Romaine appeared upon the
threshold.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;MR. ROMAINE CALLS ME NAMES</h2>
<p>Feeling very much of a fool to be thus taken by surprise, I
scrambled to my feet and hastened to make my visitor
welcome.&nbsp; He did not refuse me his hand; but he gave it with
a coldness and distance for which I was quite unprepared, and his
countenance, as he looked on me, was marked in a strong degree
with concern and severity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, sir, I find you here?&rsquo; said he, in tones of
little encouragement.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that you, George?&nbsp; You
can run away; I have business with your master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He showed Rowley out, and locked the door behind him.&nbsp;
Then he sat down in an armchair on one side of the fire, and
looked at me with uncompromising sternness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am hesitating how to begin,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In this singular labyrinth of blunders and difficulties
that you have prepared for us, I am positively hesitating where
to begin.&nbsp; It will perhaps be best that you should read,
first of all, this paragraph.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he handed over to
me a newspaper.</p>
<p>The paragraph in question was brief.&nbsp; It announced the
recapture of one of the prisoners recently escaped from Edinburgh
Castle; gave his name, Clausel, and added that he had entered
into the particulars of the recent revolting murder in the
Castle, and denounced the murderer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It is a common soldier called Champdivers,
who had himself escaped, and is in all probability involved in
the common fate of his comrades.&nbsp; In spite of the activity
along all the Forth and the East Coast, nothing has yet been seen
of the sloop which these desperadoes seized at Grangemouth, and
it is now almost certain that they have found a watery
grave.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the reading of this paragraph, my heart turned over.&nbsp;
In a moment I saw my castle in the air ruined; myself changed
from a mere military fugitive into a hunted murderer, fleeing
from the gallows; my love, which had a moment since appeared so
near to me, blotted from the field of possibility.&nbsp; Despair,
which was my first sentiment, did not, however, endure for more
than a moment.&nbsp; I saw that my companions had indeed
succeeded in their unlikely design; and that I was supposed to
have accompanied and perished along with them by
shipwreck&mdash;a most probable ending to their enterprise.&nbsp;
If they thought me at the bottom of the North Sea, I need not
fear much vigilance on the streets of Edinburgh.&nbsp;
Champdivers was wanted: what was to connect him with St.
Ives?&nbsp; Major Chevenix would recognise me if he met me; that
was beyond bargaining: he had seen me so often, his interest had
been kindled to so high a point, that I could hope to deceive him
by no stratagem of disguise.&nbsp; Well, even so; he would have a
competition of testimony before him: he knew Clausel, he knew me,
and I was sure he would decide for honour.&nbsp; At the same time
the image of Flora shot up in my mind&rsquo;s eye with such a
radiancy as fairly overwhelmed all other considerations; the
blood sprang to every corner of my body, and I vowed I would see
and win her, if it cost my neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very annoying, no doubt,&rsquo; said I, as I returned
the paper to Mr. Romaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is annoying your word for it?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exasperating, if you like,&rsquo; I admitted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And true?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, true in a sense,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
perhaps I had better answer that question by putting you in
possession of the facts?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think so, indeed,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>I narrated to him as much as seemed necessary of the quarrel,
the duel, the death of Goguelat, and the character of
Clausel.&nbsp; He heard me through in a forbidding silence, nor
did he at all betray the nature of his sentiments, except that,
at the episode of the scissors, I could observe his mulberry face
to turn three shades paler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I may believe you?&rsquo; said he, when I had
done.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or else conclude this interview,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you not understand that we are here discussing
matters of the gravest import?&nbsp; Can you not understand that
I feel myself weighed with a load of responsibility on your
account&mdash;that you should take this occasion to air your
fire-eating manners against your own attorney?&nbsp; There are
serious hours in life, Mr. Anne,&rsquo; he said severely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A capital charge, and that of a very brutal character and
with singularly unpleasant details; the presence of the man
Clausel, who (according to your account of it) is actuated by
sentiments of real malignity, and prepared to swear black white;
all the other witnesses scattered and perhaps drowned at sea; the
natural prejudice against a Frenchman and a runaway prisoner:
this makes a serious total for your lawyer to consider, and is by
no means lessened by the incurable folly and levity of your own
disposition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my expressions have been selected with scrupulous
accuracy,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;How did I find you,
sir, when I came to announce this catastrophe?&nbsp; You were
sitting on the hearthrug playing, like a silly baby, with a
servant, were you not, and the floor all scattered with gold and
bank paper?&nbsp; There was a tableau for you!&nbsp; It was I who
came, and you were lucky in that.&nbsp; It might have been any
one&mdash;your cousin as well as another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have me there, sir,&rsquo; I admitted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I had neglected all precautions, and you do right to be
angry.&nbsp; <i>Apropos</i>, Mr. Romaine, how did you come
yourself, and how long have you been in the house?&rsquo; I
added, surprised, on the retrospect, not to have heard him
arrive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I drove up in a chaise and pair,&rsquo; he
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any one might have heard me.&nbsp; But you
were not listening, I suppose? being so extremely at your ease in
the very house of your enemy, and under a capital charge!&nbsp;
And I have been long enough here to do your business for
you.&nbsp; Ah, yes, I did it, God forgive me!&mdash;did it before
I so much as asked you the explanation of the paragraph.&nbsp;
For some time back the will has been prepared; now it is signed;
and your uncle has heard nothing of your recent piece of
activity.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, I had no fancy to bother him on
his death-bed: you might be innocent; and at bottom I preferred
the murderer to the spy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No doubt of it but the man played a friendly part; no doubt
also that, in his ill-temper and anxiety, he expressed himself
unpalatably.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will perhaps find me over delicate,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is a word you employed&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I employ the words of my brief, sir,&rsquo; he cried,
striking with his hand on the newspaper.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is there
in six letters.&nbsp; And do not be so certain&mdash;you have not
stood your trial yet.&nbsp; It is an ugly affair, a fishy
business.&nbsp; It is highly disagreeable.&nbsp; I would give my
hand off&mdash;I mean I would give a hundred pound down, to have
nothing to do with it.&nbsp; And, situated as we are, we must at
once take action.&nbsp; There is here no choice.&nbsp; You must
at once quit this country, and get to France, or Holland, or,
indeed, to Madagascar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There may be two words to that,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so much as one syllable!&rsquo; he retorted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here is no room for argument.&nbsp; The case is nakedly
plain.&nbsp; In the disgusting position in which you have found
means to place yourself, all that is to be hoped for is
delay.&nbsp; A time may come when we shall be able to do
better.&nbsp; It cannot be now: now it would be the
gibbet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You labour under a false impression, Mr.
Romaine,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have no impatience to
figure in the dock.&nbsp; I am even as anxious as yourself to
postpone my first appearance there.&nbsp; On the other hand, I
have not the slightest intention of leaving this country, where I
please myself extremely.&nbsp; I have a good address, a ready
tongue, an English accent that passes, and, thanks to the
generosity of my uncle, as much money as I want.&nbsp; It would
be hard indeed if, with all these advantages, Mr. St. Ives should
not be able to live quietly in a private lodging, while the
authorities amuse themselves by looking for Champdivers.&nbsp;
You forget, there is no connection between these two
personages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you forget your cousin,&rsquo; retorted
Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is the link.&nbsp; There is the
tongue of the buckle.&nbsp; He knows you are
Champdivers.&rsquo;&nbsp; He put up his hand as if to
listen.&nbsp; &lsquo;And, for a wager, here he is himself!&rsquo;
he exclaimed.</p>
<p>As when a tailor takes a piece of goods upon his counter, and
rends it across, there came to our ears from the avenue the long
tearing sound of a chaise and four approaching at the top speed
of the horses.&nbsp; And, looking out between the curtains, we
beheld the lamps skimming on the smooth ascent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Romaine, wiping the window-pane that he
might see more clearly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay, that is he by the
driving!&nbsp; So he squanders money along the king&rsquo;s
highway, the triple idiot! gorging every man he meets with gold
for the pleasure of arriving&mdash;where?&nbsp; Ah, yes, where
but a debtor&rsquo;s jail, if not a criminal prison!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he that kind of a man?&rsquo; I said, staring on
these lamps as though I could decipher in them the secret of my
cousin&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will find him a dangerous kind,&rsquo; answered the
lawyer.&nbsp; &lsquo;For you, these are the lights on a lee
shore!&nbsp; I find I fall in a muse when I consider of him; what
a formidable being he once was, and what a personable! and how
near he draws to the moment that must break him utterly! we none
of us like him here; we hate him, rather; and yet I have a
sense&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think at my time of life it can be
pity&mdash;but a reluctance rather, to break anything so big and
figurative, as though he were a big porcelain pot or a big
picture of high price.&nbsp; Ay, there is what I was waiting
for!&rsquo; he cried, as the lights of a second chaise swam in
sight.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is he beyond a doubt.&nbsp; The first was
the signature and the next the flourish.&nbsp; Two chaises, the
second following with the baggage, which is always copious and
ponderous, and one of his valets: he cannot go a step without a
valet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hear you repeat the word big,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But it cannot be that he is anything out of the way in
stature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the attorney.&nbsp; &lsquo;About your
height, as I guessed for the tailors, and I see nothing wrong
with the result.&nbsp; But, somehow, he commands an atmosphere;
he has a spacious manner; and he has kept up, all through life,
such a volume of racket about his personality, with his chaises
and his racers and his dicings, and I know not what&mdash;that
somehow he imposes!&nbsp; It seems, when the farce is done, and
he locked in Fleet prison&mdash;and nobody left but Buonaparte
and Lord Wellington and the Hetman Platoff to make a work
about&mdash;the world will be in a comparison quite
tranquil.&nbsp; But this is beside the mark,&rsquo; he added,
with an effort, turning again from the window.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
are now under fire, Mr. Anne, as you soldiers would say, and it
is high time we should prepare to go into action.&nbsp; He must
not see you; that would be fatal.&nbsp; All that he knows at
present is that you resemble him, and that is much more than
enough.&nbsp; If it were possible, it would be well he should not
know you were in the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite impossible, depend upon it,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Some of the servants are directly in his interests,
perhaps in his pay: Dawson, for an example.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My own idea!&rsquo; cried Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;And at
least,&rsquo; he added, as the first of the chaises drew up with
a dash in front of the portico, &lsquo;it is now too late.&nbsp;
Here he is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We stood listening, with a strange anxiety, to the various
noises that awoke in the silent house: the sound of doors opening
and closing, the sound of feet near at hand and farther
off.&nbsp; It was plain the arrival of my cousin was a matter of
moment, almost of parade, to the household.&nbsp; And suddenly,
out of this confused and distant bustle, a rapid and light tread
became distinguishable.&nbsp; We heard it come upstairs, draw
near along the corridor, pause at the door, and a stealthy and
hasty rapping succeeded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Anne&mdash;Mr. Anne, sir!&nbsp; Let me in!&rsquo;
said the voice of Rowley.</p>
<p>We admitted the lad, and locked the door again behind him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <i>him</i>, sir,&rsquo; he panted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;ve come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean the Viscount?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;So
we supposed.&nbsp; But come, Rowley&mdash;out with the rest of
it!&nbsp; You have more to tell us, or your face belies you
!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Anne, I do,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Romaine, sir, you&rsquo;re a friend of his, ain&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, George, I am a friend of his,&rsquo; said Romaine,
and, to my great surprise, laid his hand upon my shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way,&rsquo; said
Rowley&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. Powl have been at me!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s to
play the spy!&nbsp; I thought he was at it from the first!&nbsp;
From the first I see what he was after&mdash;coming round and
round, and hinting things!&nbsp; But to-night he outs with it
plump!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m to let him hear all what you&rsquo;re to
do beforehand, he says; and he gave me this for an
arnest&rsquo;&mdash;holding up half a guinea; &lsquo;and I took
it, so I did!&nbsp; Strike me sky-blue scarlet?&rsquo; says he,
adducing the words of the mock oath; and he looked askance at me
as he did so.</p>
<p>I saw that he had forgotten himself, and that he knew
it.&nbsp; The expression of his eye changed almost in the passing
of the glance from the significant to the appealing&mdash;from
the look of an accomplice to that of a culprit; and from that
moment he became the model of a well-drilled valet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sky-blue scarlet?&rsquo; repeated the lawyer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is the fool delirious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;he is only reminding me of
something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;and I believe the fellow will be
faithful,&rsquo; said Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;So you are a friend
of Mr. Anne&rsquo;s&rsquo; too?&rsquo; he added to Rowley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, sir,&rsquo; said Rowley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis something sudden,&rsquo; observed Romaine;
&lsquo;but it may be genuine enough.&nbsp; I believe him to be
honest.&nbsp; He comes of honest people.&nbsp; Well, George
Rowley, you might embrace some early opportunity to earn that
half-guinea, by telling Mr. Powl that your master will not leave
here till noon to-morrow, if he go even then.&nbsp; Tell him
there are a hundred things to be done here, and a hundred more
that can only be done properly at my office in Holborn.&nbsp;
Come to think of it&mdash;we had better see to that first of
all,&rsquo; he went on, unlocking the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get hold
of Powl, and see.&nbsp; And be quick back, and clear me up this
mess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rowley was no sooner gone than the lawyer took a pinch of
snuff, and regarded me with somewhat of a more genial
expression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it is very fortunate for
you that your face is so strong a letter of recommendation.&nbsp;
Here am I, a tough old practitioner, mixing myself up with your
very distressing business; and here is this farmer&rsquo;s lad,
who has the wit to take a bribe and the loyalty to come and tell
you of it&mdash;all, I take it, on the strength of your
appearance.&nbsp; I wish I could imagine how it would impress a
jury!&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how it would affect the hangman, sir?&rsquo; I
asked</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Absit omen</i>!&rsquo; said Mr. Romaine
devoutly.</p>
<p>We were just so far in our talk, when I heard a sound that
brought my heart into my mouth: the sound of some one slyly
trying the handle of the door.&nbsp; It had been preceded by no
audible footstep.&nbsp; Since the departure of Rowley our wing of
the house had been entirely silent.&nbsp; And we had every right
to suppose ourselves alone, and to conclude that the new-comer,
whoever he might be, was come on a clandestine, if not a hostile,
errand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo; asked Romaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s only me, sir,&rsquo; said the soft voice of
Dawson.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the Viscount, sir.&nbsp; He is
very desirous to speak with you on business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell him I shall come shortly, Dawson,&rsquo; said the
lawyer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am at present engaged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir!&rsquo; said Dawson.</p>
<p>And we heard his feet draw off slowly along the corridor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Romaine, speaking low, and
maintaining the attitude of one intently listening, &lsquo;there
is another foot.&nbsp; I cannot be deceived!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think there was indeed!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And what troubles me&mdash;I am not sure that the other
has gone entirely away.&nbsp; By the time it got the length of
the head of the stair the tread was plainly single.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ahem&mdash;blockaded?&rsquo; asked the lawyer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A siege <i>en r&egrave;gle</i>!&rsquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us come farther from the door,&rsquo; said Romaine,
&lsquo;and reconsider this damnable position.&nbsp; Without
doubt, Alain was this moment at the door.&nbsp; He hoped to enter
and get a view of you, as if by accident.&nbsp; Baffled in this,
has he stayed himself, or has he planted Dawson here by way of
sentinel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Himself, beyond a doubt,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And yet to what end?&nbsp; He cannot think to pass the
night there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it were only possible to pay no heed!&rsquo; said
Mr. Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;But this is the accursed drawback of
your position.&nbsp; We can do nothing openly.&nbsp; I must
smuggle you out of this room and out of this house like seizable
goods; and how am I to set about it with a sentinel planted at
your very door?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no good in being agitated,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None at all,&rsquo; he acquiesced.&nbsp; &lsquo;And,
come to think of it, it is droll enough that I should have been
that very moment commenting on your personal appearance, when
your cousin came upon this mission.&nbsp; I was saying, if you
remember, that your face was as good or better than a letter of
recommendation.&nbsp; I wonder if M. Alain would be like the rest
of us&mdash;I wonder what he would think of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Romaine was sitting in a chair by the fire with his back
to the windows, and I was myself kneeling on the hearthrug and
beginning mechanically to pick up the scattered bills, when a
honeyed voice joined suddenly in our conversation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He thinks well of it, Mr. Romaine.&nbsp; He begs to
join himself to that circle of admirers which you indicate to
exist already.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;THE DEVIL AND ALL AT AMERSHAM PLACE</h2>
<p>Never did two human creatures get to their feet with more
alacrity than the lawyer and myself.&nbsp; We had locked and
barred the main gates of the citadel; but unhappily we had left
open the bath-room sally-port; and here we found the voice of the
hostile trumpets sounding from within, and all our defences taken
in reverse.&nbsp; I took but the time to whisper Mr. Romaine in
the ear: &lsquo;Here is another tableau for you!&rsquo; at which
he looked at me a moment with a kind of pathos, as who should
say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hit a man when he&rsquo;s
down.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then I transferred my eyes to my enemy.</p>
<p>He had his hat on, a little on one side: it was a very tall
hat, raked extremely, and had a narrow curling brim.&nbsp; His
hair was all curled out in masses like an Italian
mountebank&mdash;a most unpardonable fashion.&nbsp; He sported a
huge tippeted overcoat of frieze, such as watchmen wear, only the
inside was lined with costly furs, and he kept it half open to
display the exquisite linen, the many-coloured waistcoat, and the
profuse jewellery of watch-chains and brooches underneath.&nbsp;
The leg and the ankle were turned to a miracle.&nbsp; It is out
of the question that I should deny the resemblance altogether,
since it has been remarked by so many different persons whom I
cannot reasonably accuse of a conspiracy.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact, I saw little of it and confessed to nothing.&nbsp;
Certainly he was what some might call handsome, of a pictorial,
exuberant style of beauty, all attitude, profile, and impudence:
a man whom I could see in fancy parade on the grand stand at a
race-meeting or swagger in Piccadilly, staring down the women,
and stared at himself with admiration by the coal-porters.&nbsp;
Of his frame of mind at that moment his face offered a lively if
an unconscious picture.&nbsp; He was lividly pale, and his lip
was caught up in a smile that could almost be called a snarl, of
a sheer, arid malignity that appalled me and yet put me on my
mettle for the encounter.&nbsp; He looked me up and down, then
bowed and took off his hat to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My cousin, I presume?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand I have that honour,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The honour is mine,&rsquo; said he, and his voice shook
as he said it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should make you welcome, I believe,&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; he inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;This poor house
has been my home for longer than I care to claim.&nbsp; That you
should already take upon yourself the duties of host here is to
be at unnecessary pains.&nbsp; Believe me, that part would be
more becomingly mine.&nbsp; And, by the way, I must not fail to
offer you my little compliment.&nbsp; It is a gratifying surprise
to meet you in the dress of a gentleman, and to
see&rsquo;&mdash;with a circular look upon the scattered
bills&mdash;&lsquo;that your necessities have already been so
liberally relieved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I bowed with a smile that was perhaps no less hateful than his
own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are so many necessities in this world,&rsquo;
said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Charity has to choose.&nbsp; One gets
relieved, and some other, no less indigent, perhaps indebted,
must go wanting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Malice is an engaging trait,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And envy, I think?&rsquo; was my reply.</p>
<p>He must have felt that he was not getting wholly the better of
this passage at arms; perhaps even feared that he should lose
command of his temper, which he reined in throughout the
interview as with a red-hot curb, for he flung away from me at
the word, and addressed the lawyer with insulting arrogance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Romaine,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;since when have you
presumed to give orders in this house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not prepared to admit that I have given
any,&rsquo; replied Romaine; &lsquo;certainly none that did not
fall in the sphere of my responsibilities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By whose orders, then, am I denied entrance to my
uncle&rsquo;s room?&rsquo; said my cousin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the doctor&rsquo;s, sir,&rsquo; replied Romaine;
&lsquo;and I think even you will admit his faculty to give
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have a care, sir,&rsquo; cried Alain.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do
not be puffed up with your position.&nbsp; It is none so secure,
Master Attorney.&nbsp; I should not wonder in the least if you
were struck off the rolls for this night&rsquo;s work, and the
next I should see of you were when I flung you alms at a pothouse
door to mend your ragged elbows.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s
orders?&nbsp; But I believe I am not mistaken!&nbsp; You have
to-night transacted business with the Count; and this needy young
gentleman has enjoyed the privilege of still another interview,
in which (as I am pleased to see) his dignity has not prevented
his doing very well for himself.&nbsp; I wonder that you should
care to prevaricate with me so idly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will confess so much,&rsquo; said Mr. Romaine,
&lsquo;if you call it prevarication.&nbsp; The order in question
emanated from the Count himself.&nbsp; He does not wish to see
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For which I must take the word of Mr. Daniel
Romaine?&rsquo; asked Alain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In default of any better,&rsquo; said Romaine.</p>
<p>There was an instantaneous convulsion in my cousin&rsquo;s
face, and I distinctly heard him gnash his teeth at this reply;
but, to my surprise, he resumed in tones of almost good
humour:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Mr. Romaine, do not let us be petty!&rsquo;&nbsp;
He drew in a chair and sat down.&nbsp; &lsquo;Understand you have
stolen a march upon me.&nbsp; You have introduced your soldier of
Napoleon, and (how, I cannot conceive) he has been apparently
accepted with favour.&nbsp; I ask no better proof than the funds
with which I find him literally surrounded&mdash;I presume in
consequence of some extravagance of joy at the first sight of so
much money.&nbsp; The odds are so far in your favour, but the
match is not yet won.&nbsp; Questions will arise of undue
influence, of sequestration, and the like: I have my witnesses
ready.&nbsp; I tell it you cynically, for you cannot profit by
the knowledge; and, if the worst come to the worst, I have good
hopes of recovering my own and of ruining you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do what you please,&rsquo; answered Romaine;
&lsquo;but I give it you for a piece of good advice, you had best
do nothing in the matter.&nbsp; You will only make yourself
ridiculous; you will only squander money, of which you have none
too much, and reap public mortification.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, but there you make the common mistake, Mr.
Romaine!&rsquo; returned Alain.&nbsp; &lsquo;You despise your
adversary.&nbsp; Consider, if you please, how very disagreeable I
could make myself, if I chose.&nbsp; Consider the position of
your <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>&mdash;an escaped
prisoner!&nbsp; But I play a great game.&nbsp; I condemn such
petty opportunities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this Romaine and I exchanged a glance of triumph.&nbsp; It
seemed manifest that Alain had as yet received no word of
Clausel&rsquo;s recapture and denunciation.&nbsp; At the same
moment the lawyer, thus relieved of the instancy of his fear,
changed his tactics.&nbsp; With a great air of unconcern, he
secured the newspaper, which still lay open before him on the
table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think, Monsieur Alain, that you labour under some
illusion,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Believe me, this is all
beside the mark.&nbsp; You seem to be pointing to some
compromise.&nbsp; Nothing is further from my views.&nbsp; You
suspect me of an inclination to trifle with you, to conceal how
things are going.&nbsp; I cannot, on the other hand, be too early
or too explicit in giving you information which concerns you (I
must say) capitally.&nbsp; Your great-uncle has to-night
cancelled his will, and made a new one in favour of your cousin
Anne.&nbsp; Nay, and you shall hear it from his own lips, if you
choose!&nbsp; I will take so much upon me,&rsquo; said the
lawyer, rising.&nbsp; &lsquo;Follow me, if you please,
gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Romaine led the way out of the room so briskly, and was so
briskly followed by Alain, that I had hard ado to get the
remainder of the money replaced and the despatch-box locked, and
to overtake them, even by running ere they should be lost in that
maze of corridors, my uncle&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; As it was, I
went with a heart divided; and the thought of my treasure thus
left unprotected, save by a paltry lid and lock that any one
might break or pick open, put me in a perspiration whenever I had
the time to remember it.&nbsp; The lawyer brought us to a room,
begged us to be seated while he should hold a consultation with
the doctor, and, slipping out of another door, left Alain and
myself closeted together.</p>
<p>Truly he had done nothing to ingratiate himself; his every
word had been steeped in unfriendliness, envy, and that contempt
which (as it is born of anger) it is possible to support without
humiliation.&nbsp; On my part, I had been little more
conciliating; and yet I began to be sorry for this man, hired spy
as I knew him to be.&nbsp; It seemed to me less than decent that
he should have been brought up in the expectation of this great
inheritance, and now, at the eleventh hour, be tumbled forth out
of the house door and left to himself, his poverty and his
debts&mdash;those debts of which I had so ungallantly reminded
him so short a time before.&nbsp; And we were scarce left alone
ere I made haste to hang out a flag of truce.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My cousin,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;trust me, you will not
find me inclined to be your enemy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused in front of me&mdash;for he had not accepted the
lawyer&rsquo;s invitation to be seated, but walked to and fro in
the apartment&mdash;took a pinch of snuff, and looked at me while
he was taking it with an air of much curiosity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it even so?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Am I so far
favoured by fortune as to have your pity?&nbsp; Infinitely
obliged, my cousin Anne!&nbsp; But these sentiments are not
always reciprocal, and I warn you that the day when I set my foot
on your neck, the spine shall break.&nbsp; Are you acquainted
with the properties of the spine?&rsquo; he asked with an
insolence beyond qualification.</p>
<p>It was too much.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am acquainted also with the
properties of a pair of pistols,&rsquo; said I, toising him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; says he, holding up his
finger.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will take my revenge how and when I
please.&nbsp; We are enough of the same family to understand each
other, perhaps; and the reason why I have not had you arrested on
your arrival, why I had not a picket of soldiers in the first
clump of evergreens, to await and prevent your coming&mdash;I,
who knew all, before whom that pettifogger, Romaine, has been
conspiring in broad daylight to supplant me&mdash;is simply this:
that I had not made up my mind how I was to take my
revenge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment he was interrupted by the tolling of a
bell.&nbsp; As we stood surprised and listening, it was succeeded
by the sound of many feet trooping up the stairs and shuffling by
the door of our room.&nbsp; Both, I believe, had a great
curiosity to set it open, which each, owing to the presence of
the other, resisted; and we waited instead in silence, and
without moving, until Romaine returned and bade us to my
uncle&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>He led the way by a little crooked passage, which brought us
out in the sick-room, and behind the bed.&nbsp; I believe I have
forgotten to remark that the Count&rsquo;s chamber was of
considerable dimensions.&nbsp; We beheld it now crowded with the
servants and dependants of the house, from the doctor and the
priest to Mr. Dawson and the housekeeper, from Dawson down to
Rowley and the last footman in white calves, the last plump
chambermaid in her clean gown and cap, and the last ostler in a
stable waiscoat.&nbsp; This large congregation of persons (and I
was surprised to see how large it was) had the appearance, for
the most part, of being ill at ease and heartily bewildered,
standing on one foot, gaping like zanies, and those who were in
the corners nudging each other and grinning aside.&nbsp; My
uncle, on the other hand, who was raised higher than I had yet
seen him on his pillows, wore an air of really imposing
gravity.&nbsp; No sooner had we appeared behind him, than he
lifted his voice to a good loudness, and addressed the
assemblage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I take you all to witness&mdash;can you hear
me?&mdash;I take you all to witness that I recognise as my heir
and representative this gentleman, whom most of you see for the
first time, the Viscount Anne de St.-Yves, my nephew of the
younger line.&nbsp; And I take you to witness at the same time
that, for very good reasons known to myself, I have discarded and
disinherited this other gentleman whom you all know, the Viscount
de St.-Yves.&nbsp; I have also to explain the unusual trouble to
which I have put you all&mdash;and, since your supper was not
over, I fear I may even say annoyance.&nbsp; It has pleased M.
Alain to make some threats of disputing my will, and to pretend
that there are among your number certain estimable persons who
may be trusted to swear as he shall direct them.&nbsp; It pleases
me thus to put it out of his power and to stop the mouths of his
false witnesses.&nbsp; I am infinitely obliged by your
politeness, and I have the honour to wish you all a very good
evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the servants, still greatly mystified, crowded out of the
sickroom door, curtseying, pulling the forelock, scraping with
the foot, and so on, according to their degree, I turned and
stole a look at my cousin.&nbsp; He had borne this crushing
public rebuke without change of countenance.&nbsp; He stood, now,
very upright, with folded arms, and looking inscrutably at the
roof of the apartment.&nbsp; I could not refuse him at that
moment the tribute of my admiration.&nbsp; Still more so when,
the last of the domestics having filed through the doorway and
left us alone with my great-uncle and the lawyer, he took one
step forward towards the bed, made a dignified reverence, and
addressed the man who had just condemned him to ruin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are pleased to
treat me in a manner which my gratitude, and your state, equally
forbid me to call in question.&nbsp; It will be only necessary
for me to call your attention to the length of time in which I
have been taught to regard myself as your heir.&nbsp; In that
position, I judged it only loyal to permit myself a certain scale
of expenditure.&nbsp; If I am now to be cut off with a shilling
as the reward of twenty years of service, I shall be left not
only a beggar, but a bankrupt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whether from the fatigue of his recent exertion, or by a
well-inspired ingenuity of hate, my uncle had once more closed
his eyes; nor did he open them now.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not with a
shilling,&rsquo; he contented himself with replying; and there
stole, as he said it, a sort of smile over his face, that
flickered there conspicuously for the least moment of time, and
then faded and left behind the old impenetrable mask of years,
cunning, and fatigue.&nbsp; There could be no mistake: my uncle
enjoyed the situation as he had enjoyed few things in the last
quarter of a century.&nbsp; The fires of life scarce survived in
that frail body; but hatred, like some immortal quality, was
still erect and unabated.</p>
<p>Nevertheless my cousin persevered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I speak at a disadvantage,&rsquo; he resumed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My supplanter, with perhaps more wisdom than delicacy,
remains in the room,&rsquo; and he cast a glance at me that might
have withered an oak tree.</p>
<p>I was only too willing to withdraw, and Romaine showed as much
alacrity to make way for my departure.&nbsp; But my uncle was not
to be moved.&nbsp; In the same breath of a voice, and still
without opening his eyes, he bade me remain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; said Alain.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot
then go on to remind you of the twenty years that have passed
over our heads in England, and the services I may have rendered
you in that time.&nbsp; It would be a position too odious.&nbsp;
Your lordship knows me too well to suppose I could stoop to such
ignominy.&nbsp; I must leave out all my defence&mdash;your
lordship wills it so!&nbsp; I do not know what are my faults; I
know only my punishment, and it is greater than I have the
courage to face.&nbsp; My uncle, I implore your pity: pardon me
so far; do not send me for life into a debtors&rsquo;
jail&mdash;a pauper debtor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Chat et vieux</i>, <i>pardonnez</i>?&rsquo; said my
uncle, quoting from La Fontaine; and then, opening a pale-blue
eye full on Alain, he delivered with some emphasis:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;La jeunesse se flatte et croit tout
obtenir;<br />
La vieillesse est impitoyable.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blood leaped darkly into Alain&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; He
turned to Romaine and me, and his eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is your turn now,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;At
least it shall be prison for prison with the two
viscounts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so, Mr. Alain, by your leave,&rsquo; said
Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are a few formalities to be
considered first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Alain was already striding towards the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop a moment, stop a moment!&rsquo; cried
Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Remember your own counsel not to despise an
adversary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alain turned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I do not despise I hate you!&rsquo; he cried, giving
a loose to his passion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be warned of that, both of
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand you to threaten Monsieur le Vicomte
Anne,&rsquo; said the lawyer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know, I would
not do that.&nbsp; I am afraid, I am very much afraid, if you
were to do as you propose, you might drive me into
extremes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have made me a beggar and a bankrupt,&rsquo; said
Alain.&nbsp; What extreme is left?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I scarce like to put a name upon it in this
company,&rsquo; replied Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;But there are worse
things than even bankruptcy, and worse places than a
debtors&rsquo; jail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The words were so significantly said that there went a visible
thrill through Alain; sudden as a sword-stroke, he fell pale
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not understand you,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, you do,&rsquo; returned Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
believe you understand me very well.&nbsp; You must not suppose
that all this time, while you were so very busy, others were
entirely idle.&nbsp; You must not fancy, because I am an
Englishman, that I have not the intelligence to pursue an
inquiry.&nbsp; Great as is my regard for the honour of your
house, M. Alain de St.-Yves, if I hear of you moving directly or
indirectly in this matter, I shall do my duty, let it cost what
it will: that is, I shall communicate the real name of the
Buonapartist spy who signs his letters <i>Rue Gr&eacute;goire de
Tours</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I confess my heart was already almost altogether on the side
of my insulted and unhappy cousin; and if it had not been before,
it must have been so now, so horrid was the shock with which he
heard his infamy exposed.&nbsp; Speech was denied him; he carried
his hand to his neckcloth; he staggered; I thought he must have
fallen.&nbsp; I ran to help him, and at that he revived, recoiled
before me, and stood there with arms stretched forth as if to
preserve himself from the outrage of my touch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hands off!&rsquo; he somehow managed to articulate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will now, I hope,&rsquo; pursued the lawyer,
without any change of voice, &lsquo;understand the position in
which you are placed, and how delicately it behoves you to
conduct yourself.&nbsp; Your arrest hangs, if I may so express
myself, by a hair; and as you will be under the perpetual
vigilance of myself and my agents, you must look to it narrowly
that you walk straight.&nbsp; Upon the least dubiety, I will take
action.&rsquo;&nbsp; He snuffed, looking critically at the
tortured man.&nbsp; &lsquo;And now let me remind you that your
chaise is at the door.&nbsp; This interview is agitating to his
lordship&mdash;it cannot be agreeable for you&mdash;and I suggest
that it need not be further drawn out.&nbsp; It does not enter
into the views of your uncle, the Count, that you should again
sleep under this roof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Alain turned and passed without a word or a sign from the
apartment, I instantly followed.&nbsp; I suppose I must be at
bottom possessed of some humanity; at least, this accumulated
torture, this slow butchery of a man as by quarters of rock, had
wholly changed my sympathies.&nbsp; At that moment I loathed both
my uncle and the lawyer for their coldblooded cruelty.</p>
<p>Leaning over the banisters, I was but in time to hear his
hasty footsteps in that hall that had been crowded with servants
to honour his coming, and was now left empty against his
friendless departure.&nbsp; A moment later, and the echoes rang,
and the air whistled in my ears, as he slammed the door on his
departing footsteps.&nbsp; The fury of the concussion gave me
(had one been still wanted) a measure of the turmoil of his
passions.&nbsp; In a sense, I felt with him; I felt how he would
have gloried to slam that door on my uncle, the lawyer, myself,
and the whole crowd of those who had been witnesses to his
humiliation.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX&mdash;AFTER THE STORM</h2>
<p>No sooner was the house clear of my cousin than I began to
reckon up, ruefully enough, the probable results of what had
passed.&nbsp; Here were a number of pots broken, and it looked to
me as if I should have to pay for all!&nbsp; Here had been this
proud, mad beast goaded and baited both publicly and privately,
till he could neither hear nor see nor reason; whereupon the gate
had been set open, and he had been left free to go and contrive
whatever vengeance he might find possible.&nbsp; I could not help
thinking it was a pity that, whenever I myself was inclined to be
upon my good behaviour, some friends of mine should always
determine to play a piece of heroics and cast me for the
hero&mdash;or the victim&mdash;which is very much the same.&nbsp;
The first duty of heroics is to be of your own choosing.&nbsp;
When they are not that, they are nothing.&nbsp; And I assure you,
as I walked back to my own room, I was in no very complaisant
humour: thought my uncle and Mr. Romaine to have played
knuckle-bones with my life and prospects; cursed them for it
roundly; had no wish more urgent than to avoid the pair of them;
and was quite knocked out of time, as they say in the ring, to
find myself confronted with the lawyer.</p>
<p>He stood on my hearthrug, leaning on the chimney-piece, with a
gloomy, thoughtful brow, as I was pleased to see, and not in the
least as though he were vain of the late proceedings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have done it
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he gone?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is gone,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;We shall have
the devil to pay with him when he comes back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are right,&rsquo; said the lawyer, &lsquo;and very
little to pay him with but flams and fabrications, like
to-night&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-night&rsquo;s?&rsquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, to-night&rsquo;s!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-night&rsquo;s <i>what</i>?&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-night&rsquo;s flams and fabrications.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God be good to me, sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;have I
something more to admire in your conduct than ever <i>I</i> had
suspected?&nbsp; You cannot think how you interest me!&nbsp; That
it was severe, I knew; I had already chuckled over that.&nbsp;
But that it should be false also!&nbsp; In what sense, dear
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I believe I was extremely offensive as I put the question, but
the lawyer paid no heed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;False in all senses of the word,&rsquo; he replied
seriously.&nbsp; &lsquo;False in the sense that they were not
true, and false in the sense that they were not real; false in
the sense that I boasted, and in the sense that I lied.&nbsp; How
can I arrest him?&nbsp; Your uncle burned the papers!&nbsp; I
told you so&mdash;but doubtless you have forgotten&mdash;the day
I first saw you in Edinburgh Castle.&nbsp; It was an act of
generosity; I have seen many of these acts, and always
regretted&mdash;always regretted!&nbsp; &ldquo;That shall be his
inheritance,&rdquo; he said, as the papers burned; he did not
mean that it should have proved so rich a one.&nbsp; How rich,
time will tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon a hundred thousand times, my dear
sir, but it strikes me you have the impudence&mdash;in the
circumstances, I may call it the indecency&mdash;to appear cast
down?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; said he: &lsquo;I am.&nbsp; I am
cast down.&nbsp; I am literally cast down.&nbsp; I feel myself
quite helpless against your cousin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, really!&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is this
serious?&nbsp; And is it perhaps the reason why you have gorged
the poor devil with every species of insult? and why you took
such surprising pains to supply me with what I had so little need
of&mdash;another enemy?&nbsp; That you were helpless against
them?&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is my last missile,&rdquo; say you;
&ldquo;my ammunition is quite exhausted: just wait till I get the
last in&mdash;it will irritate, it cannot hurt him.&nbsp;
There&mdash;you see!&mdash;he is furious now, and I am quite
helpless.&nbsp; One more prod, another kick: now he is a mere
lunatic!&nbsp; Stand behind me; I am quite helpless!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Romaine, I am asking myself as to the background or motive of
this singular jest, and whether the name of it should not be
called treachery?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can scarce wonder,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
truth it has been a singular business, and we are very fortunate
to be out of it so well.&nbsp; Yet it was not treachery: no, no,
Mr. Anne, it was not treachery; and if you will do me the favour
to listen to me for the inside of a minute, I shall demonstrate
the same to you beyond cavil.&rsquo;&nbsp; He seemed to wake up
to his ordinary briskness.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see the point?&rsquo;
he began.&nbsp; &lsquo;He had not yet read the newspaper, but who
could tell when he might?&nbsp; He might have had that damned
journal in his pocket, and how should we know?&nbsp; We
were&mdash;I may say, we are&mdash;at the mercy of the merest
twopenny accident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, true,&rsquo; said I: &lsquo;I had not thought of
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I warrant you,&rsquo; cried Romaine, &lsquo;you had
supposed it was nothing to be the hero of an interesting notice
in the journals!&nbsp; You had supposed, as like as not, it was a
form of secrecy!&nbsp; But not so in the least.&nbsp; A part of
England is already buzzing with the name of Champdivers; a day or
two more and the mail will have carried it everywhere: so
wonderful a machine is this of ours for disseminating
intelligence!&nbsp; Think of it!&nbsp; When my father was
born&mdash;but that is another story.&nbsp; To return: we had
here the elements of such a combustion as I dread to think
of&mdash;your cousin and the journal.&nbsp; Let him but glance an
eye upon that column of print, and where were we?&nbsp; It is
easy to ask; not so easy to answer, my young friend.&nbsp; And
let me tell you, this sheet is the Viscount&rsquo;s usual
reading.&nbsp; It is my conviction he had it in his
pocket.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have been unjust.&nbsp; I did not appreciate my
danger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you never do,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But yet surely that public scene&mdash;&rsquo; I
began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was madness.&nbsp; I quite agree with you,&rsquo;
Mr. Romaine interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it was your
uncle&rsquo;s orders, Mr. Anne, and what could I do?&nbsp; Tell
him you were the murderer of Goguelat?&nbsp; I think
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sure!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;That would but
have been to make the trouble thicker.&nbsp; We were certainly in
a very ill posture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not yet appreciate how grave it was,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was necessary for you that your cousin
should go, and go at once.&nbsp; You yourself had to leave
to-night under cover of darkness, and how could you have done
that with the Viscount in the next room?&nbsp; He must go, then;
he must leave without delay.&nbsp; And that was the
difficulty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me, Mr. Romaine, but could not my uncle have
bidden him go?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I see I must tell you that this is not so simple
as it sounds,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;You say this is
your uncle&rsquo;s house, and so it is.&nbsp; But to all effects
and purposes it is your cousin&rsquo;s also.&nbsp; He has rooms
here; has had them coming on for thirty years now, and they are
filled with a prodigious accumulation of trash&mdash;stays, I
dare say, and powder-puffs, and such effeminate idiocy&mdash;to
which none could dispute his title, even suppose any one wanted
to.&nbsp; We had a perfect right to bid him go, and he had a
perfect right to reply, &ldquo;Yes, I will go, but not without my
stays and cravats.&nbsp; I must first get together the
nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine chestsfull of insufferable rubbish,
that I have spent the last thirty years collecting&mdash;and may
very well spend the next thirty hours a-packing of.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And what should we have said to that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By way of repartee?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two
tall footmen and a pair of crabtree cudgels, I
suggest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Lord deliver me from the wisdom of laymen!&rsquo;
cried Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put myself in the wrong at the
beginning of a lawsuit?&nbsp; No, indeed!&nbsp; There was but one
thing to do, and I did it, and burned my last cartridge in the
doing of it.&nbsp; I stunned him.&nbsp; And it gave us three
hours, by which we should make haste to profit; for if there is
one thing sure, it is that he will be up to time again to-morrow
in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I own myself an
idiot.&nbsp; Well do they say, <i>an old soldier</i>, <i>an old
innocent</i>!&nbsp; For I guessed nothing of all this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, guessing it, have you the same objections to leave
England?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The same,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is indispensable,&rsquo; he objected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it cannot be,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Reason
has nothing to say in the matter; and I must not let you squander
any of yours.&nbsp; It will be enough to tell you this is an
affair of the heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it even so?&rsquo; quoth Romaine, nodding his
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I might have been sure of it.&nbsp; Place
them in a hospital, put them in a jail in yellow overalls, do
what you will, young Jessamy finds young Jenny.&nbsp; O, have it
your own way; I am too old a hand to argue with young gentlemen
who choose to fancy themselves in love; I have too much
experience, thank you.&nbsp; Only, be sure that you appreciate
what you risk: the prison, the dock, the gallows, and the
halter&mdash;terribly vulgar circumstances, my young friend;
grim, sordid, earnest; no poetry in that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there I am warned,&rsquo; I returned gaily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No man could be warned more finely or with a greater
eloquence.&nbsp; And I am of the same opinion still.&nbsp; Until
I have again seen that lady, nothing shall induce me to quit
Great Britain.&nbsp; I have besides&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And here I came to a full stop.&nbsp; It was upon my tongue to
have told him the story of the drovers, but at the first word of
it my voice died in my throat.&nbsp; There might be a limit to
the lawyer&rsquo;s toleration, I reflected.&nbsp; I had not been
so long in Britain altogether; for the most part of that time I
had been by the heels in limbo in Edinburgh Castle; and already I
had confessed to killing one man with a pair of scissors; and now
I was to go on and plead guilty to having settled another with a
holly stick!&nbsp; A wave of discretion went over me as cold and
as deep as the sea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In short, sir, this is a matter of feeling,&rsquo; I
concluded, &lsquo;and nothing will prevent my going to
Edinburgh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If I had fired a pistol in his ear he could not have been more
startled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Edinburgh?&rsquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Edinburgh? where the very paving-stones know
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then is the murder out!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But, Mr. Romaine, is there not sometimes safety in
boldness?&nbsp; Is it not a common-place of strategy to get where
the enemy least expects you?&nbsp; And where would he expect me
less?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith, there is something in that, too!&rsquo; cried
the lawyer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay, certainly, a great deal in
that.&nbsp; All the witnesses drowned but one, and he safe in
prison; you yourself changed beyond recognition&mdash;let us
hope&mdash;and walking the streets of the very town you have
illustrated by your&mdash;well, your eccentricity!&nbsp; It is
not badly combined, indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You approve it, then?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, approve!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;there is no question
of approval.&nbsp; There is only one course which I could
approve, and that were to escape to France instanter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not wholly disapprove, at least?&rsquo; I
substituted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not wholly; and it would not matter if I did,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go your own way; you are beyond
argument.&nbsp; And I am not sure that you will run more danger
by that course than by any other.&nbsp; Give the servants time to
get to bed and fall asleep, then take a country cross-road and
walk, as the rhyme has it, like blazes all night.&nbsp; In the
morning take a chaise or take the mail at pleasure, and continue
your journey with all the decorum and reserve of which you shall
be found capable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am taking the picture in,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Give me time.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the <i>tout ensemble</i> I
must see: the whole as opposed to the details.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mountebank!&rsquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I have it now; and I see myself with a servant,
and that servant is Rowley,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So as to have one more link with your uncle?&rsquo;
suggested the lawyer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very judicious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, pardon me, but that is what it is,&rsquo; I
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Judicious is the word.&nbsp; I am not
making a deception fit to last for thirty years; I do not found a
palace in the living granite for the night.&nbsp; This is a
shelter tent&mdash;a flying picture&mdash;seen, admired, and gone
again in the wink of an eye.&nbsp; What is wanted, in short, is a
<i>trompe-l&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> that shall be good enough for
twelve hours at an inn: is it not so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is, and the objection holds.&nbsp; Rowley is but
another danger,&rsquo; said Romaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rowley,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;will pass as a servant
from a distance&mdash;as a creature seen poised on the dicky of a
bowling chaise.&nbsp; He will pass at hand as a smart, civil
fellow one meets in the inn corridor, and looks back at, and
asks, and is told, &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s servant in Number
4.&rdquo;&nbsp; He will pass, in fact, all round, except with his
personal friends!&nbsp; My dear sir, pray what do you
expect?&nbsp; Of course if we meet my cousin, or if we meet
anybody who took part in the judicious exhibition of this
evening, we are lost; and who&rsquo;s denying it?&nbsp; To every
disguise, however good and safe, there is always the weak point;
you must always take (let us say&mdash;and to take a simile from
your own waistcoat pocket) a snuff box-full of risk.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll get it just as small with Rowley as with anybody
else.&nbsp; And the long and short of it is, the lad&rsquo;s
honest, he likes me, I trust him; he is my servant, or
nobody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He might not accept,&rsquo; said Romaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I bet you a thousand pounds he does!&rsquo; cried
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But no matter; all you have to do is to send him
out to-night on this cross-country business, and leave the thing
to me.&nbsp; I tell you, he will be my servant, and I tell you,
he will do well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had crossed the room, and was already overhauling my
wardrobe as I spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; concluded the lawyer, with a shrug,
&lsquo;one risk with another: <i>&agrave; la guerre comme
&agrave; la guerre</i>, as you would say.&nbsp; Let the brat come
and be useful, at least.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he was about to ring
the bell, when his eye was caught by my researches in the
wardrobe.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do not fall in love with these coats,
waistcoats, cravats, and other panoply and accoutrements by which
you are now surrounded.&nbsp; You must not run the post as a
dandy.&nbsp; It is not the fashion, even.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are pleased to be facetious, sir,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;and not according to knowledge.&nbsp; These clothes are my
life, they are my disguise; and since I can take but few of them,
I were a fool indeed if I selected hastily!&nbsp; Will you
understand, once and for all, what I am seeking?&nbsp; To be
invisible, is the first point; the second, to be invisible in a
post-chaise and with a servant.&nbsp; Can you not perceive the
delicacy of the quest?&nbsp; Nothing must be too coarse, nothing
too fine; <i>rien de voyant</i>, <i>rien qui d&eacute;tonne</i>;
so that I may leave everywhere the inconspicuous image of a
handsome young man of a good fortune travelling in proper style,
whom the landlord will forget in twelve hours&mdash;and the
chambermaid perhaps remember, God bless her! with a sigh.&nbsp;
This is the very fine art of dress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have practised it with success for fifty
years,&rsquo; said Romaine, with a chuckle.&nbsp; &lsquo;A black
suit and a clean shirt is my infallible recipe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You surprise me; I did not think you would be
shallow!&rsquo; said I, lingering between two coats.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pray, Mr. Romaine, have I your head? or did you travel
post and with a smartish servant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither, I admit,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which change the whole problem,&rsquo; I
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have to dress for a smartish servant
and a Russia leather despatch-box.&rsquo;&nbsp; That brought me
to a stand.&nbsp; I came over and looked at the box with a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I
resumed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, and for the despatch-box!&nbsp; It
looks moneyed and landed; it means I have a lawyer.&nbsp; It is
an invaluable property.&nbsp; But I could have wished it to hold
less money.&nbsp; The responsibility is crushing.&nbsp; Should I
not do more wisely to take five hundred pounds, and intrust the
remainder with you, Mr. Romaine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are sure you will not want it,&rsquo; answered
Romaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am far from sure of that,&rsquo; cried I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In the first place, as a philosopher.&nbsp; This is the
first time I have been at the head of a large sum, and it is
conceivable&mdash;who knows himself?&mdash;that I may make it
fly.&nbsp; In the second place, as a fugitive.&nbsp; Who knows
what I may need?&nbsp; The whole of it may be inadequate.&nbsp;
But I can always write for more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not understand,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I break off all communication with you here and now.&nbsp;
You must give me a power of attorney ere you start to-night, and
then be done with me trenchantly until better days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I believe I offered some objection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think a little for once of me!&rsquo; said
Romaine.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must not have seen you before
to-night.&nbsp; To-night we are to have had our only interview,
and you are to have given me the power; and to-night I am to have
lost sight of you again&mdash;I know not whither, you were upon
business, it was none of my affairs to question you!&nbsp; And
this, you are to remark, in the interests of your own safety much
more than mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not even to write to you?&rsquo; I said, a little
bewildered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe I am cutting the last strand that connects
you with common sense,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;But that
is the plain English of it.&nbsp; You are not even to write; and
if you did, I would not answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A letter, however&mdash;&rsquo; I began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen to me,&rsquo; interrupted Romaine.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So soon as your cousin reads the paragraph, what will he
do?&nbsp; Put the police upon looking into my
correspondence!&nbsp; So soon as you write to me, in short, you
write to Bow Street; and if you will take my advice, you will
date that letter from France.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The devil!&rsquo; said I, for I began suddenly to see
that this might put me out of the way of my business.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it now?&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There will be more to be done, then, before we can
part,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I give you the whole night,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So long as you are off ere daybreak, I am
content.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In short, Mr. Romaine,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I have had
so much benefit of your advice and services that I am loth to
sever the connection, and would even ask a substitute.&nbsp; I
would be obliged for a letter of introduction to one of your own
cloth in Edinburgh&mdash;an old man for choice, very experienced,
very respectable, and very secret.&nbsp; Could you favour me with
such a letter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, no,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Certainly
not.&nbsp; I will do no such thing, indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be a great favour, sir,&rsquo; I pleaded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be an unpardonable blunder,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;What?&nbsp; Give you a letter of
introduction? and when the police come, I suppose, I must forget
the circumstance?&nbsp; No, indeed.&nbsp; Talk of it no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to be always in the right,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;The letter would be out of the question, I quite
see that.&nbsp; But the lawyer&rsquo;s name might very well have
dropped from you in the way of conversation; having heard him
mentioned, I might profit by the circumstance to introduce
myself; and in this way my business would be the better done, and
you not in the least compromised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this business?&rsquo; said Romaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not said that I had any,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It might arise.&nbsp; This is only a possibility that I
must keep in view.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, with a gesture of the hands,
&lsquo;I mention Mr. Robbie; and let that be an end of
it!&mdash;Or wait!&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;I have it.&nbsp; Here
is something that will serve you for an introduction, and cannot
compromise me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he wrote his name and the
Edinburgh lawyer&rsquo;s address on a piece of card and tossed it
to me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI&mdash;I BECOME THE OWNER OF A CLARET-COLOURED
CHAISE</h2>
<p>What with packing, signing papers, and partaking of an
excellent cold supper in the lawyer&rsquo;s room, it was past two
in the morning before we were ready for the road.&nbsp; Romaine
himself let us out of a window in a part of the house known to
Rowley: it appears it served as a kind of postern to the
servants&rsquo; hall, by which (when they were in the mind for a
clandestine evening) they would come regularly in and out; and I
remember very well the vinegar aspect of the lawyer on the
receipt of this piece of information&mdash;how he pursed his
lips, jutted his eyebrows, and kept repeating, &lsquo;This must
be seen to, indeed! this shall be barred to-morrow in the
morning!&rsquo;&nbsp; In this preoccupation, I believe he took
leave of me without observing it; our things were handed out; we
heard the window shut behind us; and became instantly lost in a
horrid intricacy of blackness and the shadow of woods.</p>
<p>A little wet snow kept sleepily falling, pausing, and falling
again; it seemed perpetually beginning to snow and perpetually
leaving off; and the darkness was intense.&nbsp; Time and again
we walked into trees; time and again found ourselves adrift among
garden borders or stuck like a ram in the thicket.&nbsp; Rowley
had possessed himself of the matches, and he was neither to be
terrified nor softened.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I will not, Mr. Anne,
sir,&rsquo; he would reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know he tell me to
wait till we were over the &rsquo;ill.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only a
little way now.&nbsp; Why, and I thought you was a soldier,
too!&rsquo;&nbsp; I was at least a very glad soldier when my
valet consented at last to kindle a thieves&rsquo; match.&nbsp;
From this, we easily lit the lantern; and thenceforward, through
a labyrinth of woodland paths, were conducted by its uneasy
glimmer.&nbsp; Both booted and great-coated, with tall hats much
of a shape, and laden with booty in the form of a despatch-box, a
case of pistols, and two plump valises, I thought we had very
much the look of a pair of brothers returning from the sack of
Amersham Place.</p>
<p>We issued at last upon a country by-road where we might walk
abreast and without precaution.&nbsp; It was nine miles to
Aylesbury, our immediate destination; by a watch, which formed
part of my new outfit, it should be about half-past three in the
morning; and as we did not choose to arrive before daylight, time
could not be said to press.&nbsp; I gave the order to march at
ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Rowley,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;so far so
good.&nbsp; You have come, in the most obliging manner in the
world, to carry these valises.&nbsp; The question is, what
next?&nbsp; What are we to do at Aylesbury? or, more
particularly, what are you?&nbsp; Thence, I go on a
journey.&nbsp; Are you to accompany me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He gave a little chuckle.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all
settled already, Mr. Anne, sir,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve got my things here in the valise&mdash;a
half a dozen shirts and what not; I&rsquo;m all ready, sir: just
you lead on: <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The devil you have!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
made pretty sure of your welcome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, sir,&rsquo; said Rowley.</p>
<p>He looked up at me, in the light of the lantern, with a boyish
shyness and triumph that awoke my conscience.&nbsp; I could never
let this innocent involve himself in the perils and difficulties
that beset my course, without some hint of warning, which it was
a matter of extreme delicacy to make plain enough and not too
plain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you may think you have
made a choice, but it was blindfold, and you must make it over
again.&nbsp; The Count&rsquo;s service is a good one; what are
you leaving it for?&nbsp; Are you not throwing away the substance
for the shadow?&nbsp; No, do not answer me yet.&nbsp; You imagine
that I am a prosperous nobleman, just declared my uncle&rsquo;s
heir, on the threshold of the best of good fortune, and, from the
point of view of a judicious servant, a jewel of a master to
serve and stick to?&nbsp; Well, my boy, I am nothing of the kind,
nothing of the kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I said the words, I came to a full stop and held up the
lantern to his face.&nbsp; He stood before me, brilliantly
illuminated on the background of impenetrable night and falling
snow, stricken to stone between his double burden like an ass
between two panniers, and gaping at me like a blunderbuss.&nbsp;
I had never seen a face so predestined to be astonished, or so
susceptible of rendering the emotion of surprise; and it tempted
me as an open piano tempts the musician.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing of the sort, Rowley,&rsquo; I continued, in a
churchyard voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;These are appearances, petty
appearances.&nbsp; I am in peril, homeless, hunted.&nbsp; I count
scarce any one in England who is not my enemy.&nbsp; From this
hour I drop my name, my title; I become nameless; my name is
proscribed.&nbsp; My liberty, my life, hang by a hair.&nbsp; The
destiny which you will accept, if you go forth with me, is to be
tracked by spies, to hide yourself under a false name, to follow
the desperate pretences and perhaps share the fate of a murderer
with a price upon his head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His face had been hitherto beyond expectation, passing from
one depth to another of tragic astonishment, and really worth
paying to see; but at this it suddenly cleared.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
I ain&rsquo;t afraid!&rsquo; he said; and then, choking into
laughter, &lsquo;why, I see it from the first!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I could have beaten him.&nbsp; But I had so grossly overshot
the mark that I suppose it took me two good miles of road and
half an hour of elocution to persuade him I had been in
earnest.&nbsp; In the course of which I became so interested in
demonstrating my present danger that I forgot all about my future
safety, and not only told him the story of Goguelat, but threw in
the business of the drovers as well, and ended by blurting out
that I was a soldier of Napoleon&rsquo;s and a prisoner of
war.</p>
<p>This was far from my views when I began; and it is a common
complaint of me that I have a long tongue.&nbsp; I believe it is
a fault beloved by fortune.&nbsp; Which of you considerate
fellows would have done a thing at once so foolhardy and so wise
as to make a confidant of a boy in his teens, and positively
smelling of the nursery?&nbsp; And when had I cause to repent
it?&nbsp; There is none so apt as a boy to be the adviser of any
man in difficulties such as mine.&nbsp; To the beginnings of
virile common sense he adds the last lights of the child&rsquo;s
imagination; and he can fling himself into business with that
superior earnestness that properly belongs to play.&nbsp; And
Rowley was a boy made to my hand.&nbsp; He had a high sense of
romance, and a secret cultus for all soldiers and
criminals.&nbsp; His travelling library consisted of a chap-book
life of Wallace and some sixpenny parts of the &lsquo;Old Bailey
Sessions Papers&rsquo; by Gurney the shorthand writer; and the
choice depicts his character to a hair.&nbsp; You can imagine how
his new prospects brightened on a boy of this disposition.&nbsp;
To be the servant and companion of a fugitive, a soldier, and a
murderer, rolled in one&mdash;to live by stratagems, disguises,
and false names, in an atmosphere of midnight and mystery so
thick that you could cut it with a knife&mdash;was really, I
believe, more dear to him than his meals, though he was a great
trencherman, and something of a glutton besides.&nbsp; For
myself, as the peg by which all this romantic business hung, I
was simply idolised from that moment; and he would rather have
sacrificed his hand than surrendered the privilege of serving
me.</p>
<p>We arranged the terms of our campaign, trudging amicably in
the snow, which now, with the approach of morning, began to fall
to purpose.&nbsp; I chose the name of Ramornie, I imagine from
its likeness to Romaine; Rowley, from an irresistible conversion
of ideas, I dubbed Gammon.&nbsp; His distress was laughable to
witness: his own choice of an unassuming nickname had been Claude
Duval!&nbsp; We settled our procedure at the various inns where
we should alight, rehearsed our little manners like a piece of
drill until it seemed impossible we should ever be taken
unprepared; and in all these dispositions, you maybe sure the
despatch-box was not forgotten.&nbsp; Who was to pick it up, who
was to set it down, who was to remain beside it, who was to sleep
with it&mdash;there was no contingency omitted, all was gone into
with the thoroughness of a drill-sergeant on the one hand and a
child with a new plaything on the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, wouldn&rsquo;t it look queer if you and me was
to come to the post-house with all this luggage?&rsquo; said
Rowley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dare say,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what
else is to be done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, now, sir&mdash;you hear me,&rsquo; says
Rowley.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think it would look more natural-like if
you was to come to the post-house alone, and with nothing in your
&rsquo;ands&mdash;more like a gentleman, you know.&nbsp; And you
might say that your servant and baggage was a-waiting for you up
the road.&nbsp; I think I could manage, somehow, to make a shift
with all them dratted things&mdash;leastways if you was to give
me a &rsquo;and up with them at the start.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I would see you far enough before I allowed you to
try, Mr. Rowley!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, you would be
quite defenceless!&nbsp; A footpad that was an infant child could
rob you.&nbsp; And I should probably come driving by to find you
in a ditch with your throat cut.&nbsp; But there is something in
your idea, for all that; and I propose we put it in execution no
farther forward than the next corner of a lane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, instead of continuing to aim for Aylesbury, we
headed by cross-roads for some point to the northward of it,
whither I might assist Rowley with the baggage, and where I might
leave him to await my return in the post-chaise.</p>
<p>It was snowing to purpose, the country all white, and
ourselves walking snowdrifts, when the first glimmer of the
morning showed us an inn upon the highwayside.&nbsp; Some
distance off, under the shelter of a corner of the road and a
clump of trees, I loaded Rowley with the whole of our
possessions, and watched him till he staggered in safety into the
doors of the <i>Green Dragon</i>, which was the sign of the
house.&nbsp; Thence I walked briskly into Aylesbury, rejoicing in
my freedom and the causeless good spirits that belong to a snowy
morning; though, to be sure, long before I had arrived the snow
had again ceased to fall, and the eaves of Aylesbury were smoking
in the level sun.&nbsp; There was an accumulation of gigs and
chaises in the yard, and a great bustle going forward in the
coffee-room and about the doors of the inn.&nbsp; At these
evidences of so much travel on the road I was seized with a
misgiving lest it should be impossible to get horses, and I
should be detained in the precarious neighbourhood of my
cousin.&nbsp; Hungry as I was, I made my way first of all to the
postmaster, where he stood&mdash;a big, athletic, horsey-looking
man, blowing into a key in the corner of the yard.</p>
<p>On my making my modest request, he awoke from his indifference
into what seemed passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A po&rsquo;-shay and &rsquo;osses!&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do I look as if I &rsquo;ad a po&rsquo;-shay
and &rsquo;osses?&nbsp; Damn me, if I &rsquo;ave such a thing on
the premises.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t <i>make</i> &rsquo;osses and
chaises&mdash;I &rsquo;<i>ire</i> &rsquo;em.&nbsp; You might be
God Almighty!&rsquo; said he; and instantly, as if he had
observed me for the first time, he broke off, and lowered his
voice into the confidential.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, now that I see you
are a gentleman,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what!&nbsp; If you like to <i>buy</i>, I have the article to fit
you.&nbsp; Second-&rsquo;and shay by Lycett, of London.&nbsp;
Latest style; good as new.&nbsp; Superior fittin&rsquo;s, net on
the roof, baggage platform, pistol &rsquo;olsters&mdash;the most
com-plete and the most gen-teel turn-out I ever see!&nbsp; The
&rsquo;ole for seventy-five pound!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as good as
givin&rsquo; her away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you propose I should trundle it myself, like a
hawker&rsquo;s barrow?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, my good
man, if I had to stop here, anyway, I should prefer to buy a
house and garden!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come and look at her!&rsquo; he cried; and, with the
word, links his arm in mine and carries me to the outhouse where
the chaise was on view.</p>
<p>It was just the sort of chaise that I had dreamed of for my
purpose: eminently rich, inconspicuous, and genteel; for, though
I thought the postmaster no great authority, I was bound to agree
with him so far.&nbsp; The body was painted a dark claret, and
the wheels an invisible green.&nbsp; The lamp and glasses were
bright as silver; and the whole equipage had an air of privacy
and reserve that seemed to repel inquiry and disarm
suspicion.&nbsp; With a servant like Rowley, and a chaise like
this, I felt that I could go from the Land&rsquo;s End to John
o&rsquo; Groat&rsquo;s House amid a population of bowing
ostlers.&nbsp; And I suppose I betrayed in my manner the degree
in which the bargain tempted me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; cried the
postmaster&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make it seventy, to oblige a
friend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The point is: the horses,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, consulting his watch,
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s now gone the &rsquo;alf after eight.&nbsp; What
time do you want her at the door?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Horses and all?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Osses and all!&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
good turn deserves another.&nbsp; You give me seventy pound for
the shay, and I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;oss it for you.&nbsp; I told you
I didn&rsquo;t <i>make</i> &rsquo;osses; but I <i>can</i> make
&rsquo;em, to oblige a friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What would you have?&nbsp; It was not the wisest thing in the
world to buy a chaise within a dozen miles of my uncle&rsquo;s
house; but in this way I got my horses for the next stage.&nbsp;
And by any other it appeared that I should have to wait.&nbsp;
Accordingly I paid the money down&mdash;perhaps twenty pounds too
much, though it was certainly a well-made and well-appointed
vehicle&mdash;ordered it round in half an hour, and proceeded to
refresh myself with breakfast.</p>
<p>The table to which I sat down occupied the recess of a
bay-window, and commanded a view of the front of the inn, where I
continued to be amused by the successive departures of
travellers&mdash;the fussy and the offhand, the niggardly and the
lavish&mdash;all exhibiting their different characters in that
diagnostic moment of the farewell: some escorted to the stirrup
or the chaise door by the chamberlain, the chambermaids and the
waiters almost in a body, others moving off under a cloud,
without human countenance.&nbsp; In the course of this I became
interested in one for whom this ovation began to assume the
proportions of a triumph; not only the under-servants, but the
barmaid, the landlady, and my friend the postmaster himself,
crowding about the steps to speed his departure.&nbsp; I was
aware, at the same time, of a good deal of merriment, as though
the traveller were a man of a ready wit, and not too dignified to
air it in that society.&nbsp; I leaned forward with a lively
curiosity; and the next moment I had blotted myself behind the
teapot.&nbsp; The popular traveller had turned to wave a
farewell; and behold! he was no other than my cousin Alain.&nbsp;
It was a change of the sharpest from the angry, pallid man I had
seen at Amersham Place.&nbsp; Ruddy to a fault, illuminated with
vintages, crowned with his curls like Bacchus, he now stood
before me for an instant, the perfect master of himself, smiling
with airs of conscious popularity and insufferable
condescension.&nbsp; He reminded me at once of a royal duke, or
an actor turned a little elderly, and of a blatant bagman who
should have been the illegitimate son of a gentleman.&nbsp; A
moment after he was gliding noiselessly on the road to
London.</p>
<p>I breathed again.&nbsp; I recognised, with heartfelt
gratitude, how lucky I had been to go in by the stable-yard
instead of the hostelry door, and what a fine occasion of meeting
my cousin I had lost by the purchase of the claret-coloured
chaise!&nbsp; The next moment I remembered that there was a
waiter present.&nbsp; No doubt but he must have observed me when
I crouched behind the breakfast equipage; no doubt but he must
have commented on this unusual and undignified behaviour; and it
was essential that I should do something to remove the
impression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Waiter!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that was the nephew of
Count Carwell that just drove off, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir: Viscount Carwell we calls him,&rsquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I thought as much,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, well, damn all these Frenchmen, say I!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may say so indeed, sir,&rsquo; said the
waiter.&nbsp; &lsquo;They ain&rsquo;t not to say in the same
field with our &rsquo;ome-raised gentry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nasty tempers?&rsquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beas&rsquo;ly temper, sir, the Viscount
&rsquo;ave,&rsquo; said the waiter with feeling.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, no longer agone than this morning, he was sitting
breakfasting and reading in his paper.&nbsp; I suppose, sir, he
come on some pilitical information, or it might be about
&rsquo;orses, but he raps his &rsquo;and upon the table sudden
and calls for curacoa.&nbsp; It gave me quite a turn, it did; he
did it that sudden and &rsquo;ard.&nbsp; Now, sir, that may be
manners in France, but hall I can say is, that I&rsquo;m not used
to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reading the paper, was he?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What paper, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here it is, sir,&rsquo; exclaimed the waiter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Seems like as if he&rsquo;d dropped it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And picking it off the floor he presented it to me.</p>
<p>I may say that I was quite prepared, that I already knew what
to expect; but at sight of the cold print my heart stopped
beating.&nbsp; There it was: the fulfilment of Romaine&rsquo;s
apprehension was before me; the paper was laid open at the
capture of Clausel.&nbsp; I felt as if I could take a little
curacoa myself, but on second thoughts called for brandy.&nbsp;
It was badly wanted; and suddenly I observed the waiter&rsquo;s
eye to sparkle, as it were, with some recognition; made certain
he had remarked the resemblance between me and Alain; and became
aware&mdash;as by a revelation&mdash;of the fool&rsquo;s part I
had been playing.&nbsp; For I had now managed to put my
identification beyond a doubt, if Alain should choose to make his
inquiries at Aylesbury; and, as if that were not enough, I had
added, at an expense of seventy pounds, a clue by which he might
follow me through the length and breadth of England, in the shape
of the claret-coloured chaise!&nbsp; That elegant equipage (which
I began to regard as little better than a claret-coloured
ante-room to the hangman&rsquo;s cart) coming presently to the
door, I left my breakfast in the middle and departed; posting to
the north as diligently as my cousin Alain was posting to the
south, and putting my trust (such as it was) in an opposite
direction and equal speed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;CHARACTER AND ACQUIREMENTS OF MR.&nbsp;
ROWLEY</h2>
<p>I am not certain that I had ever really appreciated before
that hour the extreme peril of the adventure on which I was
embarked.&nbsp; The sight of my cousin, the look of his
face&mdash;so handsome, so jovial at the first sight, and branded
with so much malignity as you saw it on the second&mdash;with his
hyperbolical curls in order, with his neckcloth tied as if for
the conquests of love, setting forth (as I had no doubt in the
world he was doing) to clap the Bow Street runners on my trail,
and cover England with handbills, each dangerous as a loaded
musket, convinced me for the first time that the affair was no
less serious than death.&nbsp; I believe it came to a near touch
whether I should not turn the horses&rsquo; heads at the next
stage and make directly for the coast.&nbsp; But I was now in the
position of a man who should have thrown his gage into the den of
lions; or, better still, like one who should have quarrelled
overnight under the influence of wine, and now, at daylight, in a
cold winter&rsquo;s morning, and humbly sober, must make good his
words.&nbsp; It is not that I thought any the less, or any the
less warmly, of Flora.&nbsp; But, as I smoked a grim segar that
morning in a corner of the chaise, no doubt I considered, in the
first place, that the letter-post had been invented, and admitted
privately to myself, in the second, that it would have been
highly possible to write her on a piece of paper, seal it, and
send it skimming by the mail, instead of going personally into
these egregious dangers, and through a country that I beheld
crowded with gibbets and Bow Street officers.&nbsp; As for Sim
and Candlish, I doubt if they crossed my mind.</p>
<p>At the Green Dragon Rowley was waiting on the doorsteps with
the luggage, and really was bursting with unpalatable
conversation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who do you think we&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad &rsquo;ere,
sir?&rsquo; he began breathlessly, as the chaise drove off.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Red Breasts&rsquo;; and he nodded his head
portentously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Red Breasts?&rsquo; I repeated, for I stupidly did not
understand at the moment an expression I had often heard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Red weskits.&nbsp;
Runners.&nbsp; Bow Street runners.&nbsp; Two on&rsquo; em, and
one was Lavender himself!&nbsp; I hear the other say quite plain,
&ldquo;Now, Mr. Lavender, <i>if</i> you&rsquo;re
ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; They was breakfasting as nigh me as I am to
that postboy.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all right; they ain&rsquo;t
after us.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a forger; and I didn&rsquo;t send them
off on a false scent&mdash;O no!&nbsp; I thought there was no use
in having them over our way; so I give them &ldquo;very valuable
information,&rdquo; Mr. Lavender said, and tipped me a tizzy for
myself; and they&rsquo;re off to Luton.&nbsp; They showed me the
&rsquo;andcuffs, too&mdash;the other one did&mdash;and he clicked
the dratted things on my wrist; and I tell you, I believe I
nearly went off in a swound!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something so
beastly in the feel of them!&nbsp; Begging your pardon, Mr.
Anne,&rsquo; he added, with one of his delicious changes from the
character of the confidential schoolboy into that of the trained,
respectful servant.</p>
<p>Well, I must not be proud!&nbsp; I cannot say I found the
subject of handcuffs to my fancy; and it was with more asperity
than was needful that I reproved him for the slip about the
name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mr. Ramornie,&rsquo; says he, touching his
hat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Begging your pardon, Mr. Ramornie.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ve been very piticular, sir, up to now; and you may trust
me to be very piticular in the future.&nbsp; It were only a slip,
sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good boy,&rsquo; said I, with the most imposing
severity, &lsquo;there must be no slips.&nbsp; Be so good as to
remember that my life is at stake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I did not embrace the occasion of telling him how many I had
made myself.&nbsp; It is my principle that an officer must never
be wrong.&nbsp; I have seen two divisions beating their brains
out for a fortnight against a worthless and quite impregnable
castle in a pass: I knew we were only doing it for discipline,
because the General had said so at first, and had not yet found
any way out of his own words; and I highly admired his force of
character, and throughout these operations thought my life
exposed in a very good cause.&nbsp; With fools and children,
which included Rowley, the necessity was even greater.&nbsp; I
proposed to myself to be infallible; and even when he expressed
some wonder at the purchase of the claret-coloured chaise, I put
him promptly in his place.&nbsp; In our situation, I told him,
everything had to be sacrificed to appearances; doubtless, in a
hired chaise, we should have had more freedom, but look at the
dignity!&nbsp; I was so positive, that I had sometimes almost
convinced myself.&nbsp; Not for long, you may be certain!&nbsp;
This detestable conveyance always appeared to me to be laden with
Bow Street officers, and to have a placard upon the back of it
publishing my name and crimes.&nbsp; If I had paid seventy pounds
to get the thing, I should not have stuck at seven hundred to be
safely rid of it.</p>
<p>And if the chaise was a danger, what an anxiety was the
despatch-box and its golden cargo!&nbsp; I had never had a care
but to draw my pay and spend it; I had lived happily in the
regiment, as in my father&rsquo;s house, fed by the great
Emperor&rsquo;s commissariat as by ubiquitous doves of
Elijah&mdash;or, my faith! if anything went wrong with the
commissariat, helping myself with the best grace in the world
from the next peasant!&nbsp; And now I began to feel at the same
time the burthen of riches and the fear of destitution.&nbsp;
There were ten thousand pounds in the despatch-box, but I
reckoned in French money, and had two hundred and fifty thousand
agonies; I kept it under my hand all day, I dreamed of it at
night.&nbsp; In the inns, I was afraid to go to dinner and afraid
to go to sleep.&nbsp; When I walked up a hill I durst not leave
the doors of the claret-coloured chaise.&nbsp; Sometimes I would
change the disposition of the funds: there were days when I
carried as much as five or six thousand pounds on my own person,
and only the residue continued to voyage in the
treasure-chest&mdash;days when I bulked all over like my cousin,
crackled to a touch with bank paper, and had my pockets weighed
to bursting-point with sovereigns.&nbsp; And there were other
days when I wearied of the thing&mdash;or grew ashamed of
it&mdash;and put all the money back where it had come from: there
let it take its chance, like better people!&nbsp; In short, I set
Rowley a poor example of consistency, and in philosophy, none at
all.</p>
<p>Little he cared!&nbsp; All was one to him so long as he was
amused, and I never knew any one amused more easily.&nbsp; He was
thrillingly interested in life, travel, and his own melodramatic
position.&nbsp; All day he would be looking from the chaise
windows with ebullitions of gratified curiosity, that were
sometimes justified and sometimes not, and that (taken
altogether) it occasionally wearied me to be obliged to
share.&nbsp; I can look at horses, and I can look at trees too,
although not fond of it.&nbsp; But why should I look at a lame
horse, or a tree that was like the letter Y?&nbsp; What
exhilaration could I feel in viewing a cottage that was the same
colour as &lsquo;the second from the miller&rsquo;s&rsquo; in
some place where I had never been, and of which I had not
previously heard?&nbsp; I am ashamed to complain, but there were
moments when my juvenile and confidential friend weighed heavy on
my hands.&nbsp; His cackle was indeed almost continuous, but it
was never unamiable.&nbsp; He showed an amiable curiosity when he
was asking questions; an amiable guilelessness when he was
conferring information.&nbsp; And both he did largely.&nbsp; I am
in a position to write the biographies of Mr. Rowley, Mr.
Rowley&rsquo;s father and mother, his Aunt Eliza, and the
miller&rsquo;s dog; and nothing but pity for the reader, and some
misgivings as to the law of copyright, prevail on me to withhold
them.</p>
<p>A general design to mould himself upon my example became early
apparent, and I had not the heart to check it.&nbsp; He began to
mimic my carriage; he acquired, with servile accuracy, a little
manner I had of shrugging the shoulders; and I may say it was by
observing it in him that I first discovered it in myself.&nbsp;
One day it came out by chance that I was of the Catholic
religion.&nbsp; He became plunged in thought, at which I was
gently glad.&nbsp; Then suddenly&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Odd-rabbit it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be Catholic too!&rsquo;
he broke out.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must teach me it, Mr. Anne&mdash;I
mean, Ramornie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I dissuaded him: alleging that he would find me very
imperfectly informed as to the grounds and doctrines of the
Church, and that, after all, in the matter of religions, it was a
very poor idea to change.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course, my Church is
the best,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but that is not the reason why I
belong to it: I belong to it because it was the faith of my
house.&nbsp; I wish to take my chances with my own people, and so
should you.&nbsp; If it is a question of going to hell, go to
hell like a gentleman with your ancestors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t that,&rsquo; he admitted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I was exactly thinking of
hell.&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s the inquisition, too.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s rather a cawker, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t believe you were thinking of anything
in the world,&rsquo; said I&mdash;which put a period to his
respectable conversion.</p>
<p>He consoled himself by playing for awhile on a cheap
flageolet, which was one of his diversions, and to which I owed
many intervals of peace.&nbsp; When he first produced it, in the
joints, from his pocket, he had the duplicity to ask me if I
played upon it.&nbsp; I answered, no; and he put the instrument
away with a sigh and the remark that he had thought I
might.&nbsp; For some while he resisted the unspeakable
temptation, his fingers visibly itching and twittering about his
pocket, even his interest in the landscape and in sporadic
anecdote entirely lost.&nbsp; Presently the pipe was in his hands
again; he fitted, unfitted, refitted, and played upon it in dumb
show for some time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I play it myself a little,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you?&rsquo; said I, and yawned.</p>
<p>And then he broke down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ramornie, if you please, would it disturb you, sir,
if I was to play a chune?&rsquo; he pleaded.&nbsp; And from that
hour, the tootling of the flageolet cheered our way.</p>
<p>He was particularly keen on the details of battles, single
combats, incidents of scouting parties, and the like.&nbsp; These
he would make haste to cap with some of the exploits of Wallace,
the only hero with whom he had the least acquaintance.&nbsp; His
enthusiasm was genuine and pretty.&nbsp; When he learned we were
going to Scotland, &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; he broke out,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see where Wallace lived!&rsquo;&nbsp; And
presently after, he fell to moralising.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a
strange thing, sir,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;that I seem somehow
to have always the wrong sow by the ear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m English
after all, and I glory in it.&nbsp; My eye! don&rsquo;t I,
though!&nbsp; Let some of your Frenchies come over here to
invade, and you&rsquo;ll see whether or not!&nbsp; Oh, yes,
I&rsquo;m English to the backbone, I am.&nbsp; And yet look at
me!&nbsp; I got hold of this &rsquo;ere William Wallace and took
to him right off; I never heard of such a man before!&nbsp; And
then you came along, and I took to you.&nbsp; And both the two of
you were my born enemies!&nbsp; I&mdash;I beg your pardon, Mr.
Ramornie, but would you mind it very much if you didn&rsquo;t go
for to do anything against England&rsquo;&mdash;he brought the
word out suddenly, like something hot&mdash;&lsquo;when I was
along of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was more affected than I can tell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rowley,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you need have no
fear.&nbsp; By how much I love my own honour, by so much I will
take care to protect yours.&nbsp; We are but fraternising at the
outposts, as soldiers do.&nbsp; When the bugle calls, my boy, we
must face each other, one for England, one for France, and may
God defend the right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So I spoke at the moment; but for all my brave airs, the boy
had wounded me in a vital quarter.&nbsp; His words continued to
ring in my hearing.&nbsp; There was no remission all day of my
remorseful thoughts; and that night (which we lay at Lichfield, I
believe) there was no sleep for me in my bed.&nbsp; I put out the
candle and lay down with a good resolution; and in a moment all
was light about me like a theatre, and I saw myself upon the
stage of it playing ignoble parts.&nbsp; I remembered France and
my Emperor, now depending on the arbitrament of war, bent down,
fighting on their knees and with their teeth against so many and
such various assailants.&nbsp; And I burned with shame to be here
in England, cherishing an English fortune, pursuing an English
mistress, and not there, to handle a musket in my native fields,
and to manure them with my body if I fell.&nbsp; I remembered
that I belonged to France.&nbsp; All my fathers had fought for
her, and some had died; the voice in my throat, the sight of my
eyes, the tears that now sprang there, the whole man of me, was
fashioned of French earth and born of a French mother; I had been
tended and caressed by a succession of the daughters of France,
the fairest, the most ill-starred; and I had fought and conquered
shoulder to shoulder with her sons.&nbsp; A soldier, a noble, of
the proudest and bravest race in Europe, it had been left to the
prattle of a hobbledehoy lackey in an English chaise to recall me
to the consciousness of duty.</p>
<p>When I saw how it was I did not lose time in indecision.&nbsp;
The old classical conflict of love and honour being once fairly
before me, it did not cost me a thought.&nbsp; I was a Saint-Yves
de K&eacute;roual; and I decided to strike off on the morrow for
Wakefield and Burchell Fenn, and embark, as soon as it should be
morally possible, for the succour of my downtrodden fatherland
and my beleaguered Emperor.&nbsp; Pursuant on this resolve, I
leaped from bed, made a light, and as the watchman was crying
half-past two in the dark streets of Lichfield, sat down to pen a
letter of farewell to Flora.&nbsp; And then&mdash;whether it was
the sudden chill of the night, whether it came by association of
ideas from the remembrance of Swanston Cottage I know not, but
there appeared before me&mdash;to the barking of
sheep-dogs&mdash;a couple of snuffy and shambling figures, each
wrapped in a plaid, each armed with a rude staff; and I was
immediately bowed down to have forgotten them so long, and of
late to have thought of them so cavalierly.</p>
<p>Sure enough there was my errand!&nbsp; As a private person I
was neither French nor English; I was something else first: a
loyal gentleman, an honest man.&nbsp; Sim and Candlish must not
be left to pay the penalty of my unfortunate blow.&nbsp; They
held my honour tacitly pledged to succour them; and it is a sort
of stoical refinement entirely foreign to my nature to set the
political obligation above the personal and private.&nbsp; If
France fell in the interval for the lack of Anne de St.-Yves,
fall she must!&nbsp; But I was both surprised and humiliated to
have had so plain a duty bound upon me for so long&mdash;and for
so long to have neglected and forgotten it.&nbsp; I think any
brave man will understand me when I say that I went to bed and to
sleep with a conscience very much relieved, and woke again in the
morning with a light heart.&nbsp; The very danger of the
enterprise reassured me: to save Sim and Candlish (suppose the
worst to come to the worst) it would be necessary for me to
declare myself in a court of justice, with consequences which I
did not dare to dwell upon; it could never be said that I had
chosen the cheap and the easy&mdash;only that in a very
perplexing competition of duties I had risked my life for the
most immediate.</p>
<p>We resumed the journey with more diligence: thenceforward
posted day and night; did not halt beyond what was necessary for
meals; and the postillions were excited by gratuities, after the
habit of my cousin Alain.&nbsp; For twopence I could have gone
farther and taken four horses; so extreme was my haste, running
as I was before the terrors of an awakened conscience.&nbsp; But
I feared to be conspicuous.&nbsp; Even as it was, we attracted
only too much attention, with our pair and that white elephant,
the seventy-pounds-worth of claret-coloured chaise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I was ashamed to look Rowley in the face.&nbsp; The
young shaver had contrived to put me wholly in the wrong; he had
cost me a night&rsquo;s rest and a severe and healthful
humiliation; and I was grateful and embarrassed in his
society.&nbsp; This would never do; it was contrary to all my
ideas of discipline; if the officer has to blush before the
private, or the master before the servant, nothing is left to
hope for but discharge or death.&nbsp; I hit upon the idea of
teaching him French; and accordingly, from Lichfield, I became
the distracted master, and he the scholar&mdash;how shall I say?
indefatigable, but uninspired.&nbsp; His interest never
flagged.&nbsp; He would hear the same word twenty times with
profound refreshment, mispronounce it in several different ways,
and forget it again with magical celerity.&nbsp; Say it happened
to be <i>stirrup</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t seem to
remember that word, Mr. Anne,&rsquo; he would say: &lsquo;it
don&rsquo;t seem to stick to me, that word
don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, when I had told it him again,
&lsquo;<i>Etrier</i>!&rsquo; he would cry.&nbsp; &lsquo;To be
sure!&nbsp; I had it on the tip of my tongue.&nbsp;
<i>Eterier</i>!&rsquo; (going wrong already, as if by a fatal
instinct).&nbsp; &lsquo;What will I remember it by, now?&nbsp;
Why, <i>interior</i>, to be sure!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll remember it by
its being something that ain&rsquo;t in the interior of a
horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when next I had occasion to ask him the
French for stirrup, it was a toss-up whether he had forgotten all
about it, or gave me <i>exterior</i> for an answer.&nbsp; He was
never a hair discouraged.&nbsp; He seemed to consider that he was
covering the ground at a normal rate.&nbsp; He came up smiling
day after day.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, sir, shall we do our
French?&rsquo; he would say; and I would put questions, and
elicit copious commentary and explanation, but never the shadow
of an answer.&nbsp; My hands fell to my sides; I could have wept
to hear him.&nbsp; When I reflected that he had as yet learned
nothing, and what a vast deal more there was for him to learn,
the period of these lessons seemed to unroll before me vast as
eternity, and I saw myself a teacher of a hundred, and Rowley a
pupil of ninety, still hammering on the rudiments!&nbsp; The
wretched boy, I should say, was quite unspoiled by the inevitable
familiarities of the journey.&nbsp; He turned out at each stage
the pink of serving-lads, deft, civil, prompt, attentive,
touching his hat like an automaton, raising the status of Mr.
Ramornie in the eyes of all the inn by his smiling service, and
seeming capable of anything in the world but the one thing I had
chosen&mdash;learning French!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE ADVENTURE OF THE RUNAWAY COUPLE</h2>
<p>The country had for some time back been changing in
character.&nbsp; By a thousand indications I could judge that I
was again drawing near to Scotland.&nbsp; I saw it written in the
face of the hills, in the growth of the trees, and in the glint
of the waterbrooks that kept the high-road company.&nbsp; It
might have occurred to me, also, that I was, at the same time,
approaching a place of some fame in Britain&mdash;Gretna
Green.&nbsp; Over these same leagues of road&mdash;which Rowley
and I now traversed in the claret-coloured chaise, to the note of
the flageolet and the French lesson&mdash;how many pairs of
lovers had gone bowling northwards to the music of sixteen
scampering horseshoes; and how many irate persons, parents,
uncles, guardians, evicted rivals, had come tearing after,
clapping the frequent red face to the chaise-window, lavishly
shedding their gold about the post-houses, sedulously loading and
re-loading, as they went, their avenging pistols!&nbsp; But I
doubt if I had thought of it at all, before a wayside hazard
swept me into the thick of an adventure of this nature; and I
found myself playing providence with other people&rsquo;s lives,
to my own admiration at the moment&mdash;and subsequently to my
own brief but passionate regret.</p>
<p>At rather an ugly corner of an uphill reach I came on the
wreck of a chaise lying on one side in the ditch, a man and a
woman in animated discourse in the middle of the road, and the
two postillions, each with his pair of horses, looking on and
laughing from the saddle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Morning breezes! here&rsquo;s a smash!&rsquo; cried
Rowley, pocketing his flageolet in the middle of the <i>Tight
Little Island</i>.</p>
<p>I was perhaps more conscious of the moral smash than the
physical&mdash;more alive to broken hearts than to broken
chaises; for, as plain as the sun at morning, there was a screw
loose in this runaway match.&nbsp; It is always a bad sign when
the lower classes laugh: their taste in humour is both poor and
sinister; and for a man, running the posts with four horses,
presumably with open pockets, and in the company of the most
entrancing little creature conceivable, to have come down so far
as to be laughed at by his own postillions, was only to be
explained on the double hypothesis, that he was a fool and no
gentleman.</p>
<p>I have said they were man and woman.&nbsp; I should have said
man and child.&nbsp; She was certainly not more than seventeen,
pretty as an angel, just plump enough to damn a saint, and
dressed in various shades of blue, from her stockings to her
saucy cap, in a kind of taking gamut, the top note of which she
flung me in a beam from her too appreciative eye.&nbsp; There was
no doubt about the case: I saw it all.&nbsp; From a
boarding-school, a black-board, a piano, and Clementi&rsquo;s
<i>Sonatinas</i>, the child had made a rash adventure upon life
in the company of a half-bred hawbuck; and she was already not
only regretting it, but expressing her regret with point and
pungency.</p>
<p>As I alighted they both paused with that unmistakable air of
being interrupted in a scene.&nbsp; I uncovered to the lady and
placed my services at their disposal.</p>
<p>It was the man who answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no use
in shamming, sir,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;This lady and I
have run away, and her father&rsquo;s after us: road to Gretna,
sir.&nbsp; And here have these nincompoops spilt us in the ditch
and smashed the chaise!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very provoking,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve been so
provoked!&rsquo; cried he, with a glance down the road, of mortal
terror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The father is no doubt very much incensed?&rsquo; I
pursued civilly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O God!&rsquo; cried the hawbuck.&nbsp; &lsquo;In short,
you see, we must get out of this.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll tell you
what&mdash;it may seem cool, but necessity has no law&mdash;if
you would lend us your chaise to the next post-house, it would be
the very thing, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I confess it seems cool,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you say, sir?&rsquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was agreeing with you,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, it does seem cool; and what is more to the point, it
seems unnecessary.&nbsp; This thing can be arranged in a more
satisfactory manner otherwise, I think.&nbsp; You can doubtless
ride?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This opened a door on the matter of their previous dispute,
and the fellow appeared life-sized in his true colours.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been telling her: that, damn
her! she must ride!&rsquo; he broke out.&nbsp; &lsquo;And if the
gentleman&rsquo;s of the same mind, why, damme, you
shall!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he said so, he made a snatch at her wrist, which she evaded
with horror.</p>
<p>I stepped between them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;the lady shall
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned on me raging.&nbsp; &lsquo;And who are you to
interfere?&rsquo; he roared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is here no question of who I am,&rsquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I may be the devil or the Archbishop of
Canterbury for what you know, or need know.&nbsp; The point is
that I can help you&mdash;it appears that nobody else can; and I
will tell you how I propose to do it.&nbsp; I will give the lady
a seat in my chaise, if you will return the compliment by
allowing my servant to ride one of your horses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I thought he would have sprung at my throat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have always the alternative before you: to wait
here for the arrival of papa,&rsquo; I added.</p>
<p>And that settled him.&nbsp; He cast another haggard look down
the road, and capitulated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure, sir, the lady is very much obliged to
you,&rsquo; he said, with an ill grace.</p>
<p>I gave her my hand; she mounted like a bird into the chaise;
Rowley, grinning from ear to ear, closed the door behind us; the
two impudent rascals of post-boys cheered and laughed aloud as we
drove off; and my own postillion urged his horses at once into a
rattling trot.&nbsp; It was plain I was supposed by all to have
done a very dashing act, and ravished the bride from the
ravisher.</p>
<p>In the meantime I stole a look at the little lady.&nbsp; She
was in a state of pitiable discomposure, and her arms shook on
her lap in her black lace mittens.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam&mdash;&rsquo; I began.</p>
<p>And she, in the same moment, finding her voice: &lsquo;O, what
you must think of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;what must any gentleman
think when he sees youth, beauty and innocence in distress?&nbsp;
I wish I could tell you that I was old enough to be your father;
I think we must give that up,&rsquo; I continued, with a
smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I will tell you something about myself
which ought to do as well, and to set that little heart at rest
in my society.&nbsp; I am a lover.&nbsp; May I say it of
myself&mdash;for I am not quite used to all the niceties of
English&mdash;that I am a true lover?&nbsp; There is one whom I
admire, adore, obey; she is no less good than she is beautiful;
if she were here, she would take you to her arms: conceive that
she has sent me&mdash;that she has said to me, &ldquo;Go, be her
knight!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I know she must be sweet, I know she must be worthy
of you!&rsquo; cried the little lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;She would
never forget female decorum&mdash;nor make the terrible
<i>erratum</i> I&rsquo;ve done!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And at this she lifted up her voice and wept.</p>
<p>This did not forward matters: it was in vain that I begged her
to be more composed and to tell me a plain, consecutive tale of
her misadventures; but she continued instead to pour forth the
most extraordinary mixture of the correct school miss and the
poor untutored little piece of womanhood in a false
position&mdash;of engrafted pedantry and incoherent nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am certain it must have been judicial
blindness,&rsquo; she sobbed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think
how I didn&rsquo;t see it, but I didn&rsquo;t; and he
isn&rsquo;t, is he?&nbsp; And then a curtain rose . . . O, what a
moment was that!&nbsp; But I knew at once that <i>you were</i>;
you had but to appear from your carriage, and I knew it, O, she
must be a fortunate young lady!&nbsp; And I have no fear with
you, none&mdash;a perfect confidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;a gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean&mdash;a gentleman,&rsquo; she
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;And he&mdash;and that&mdash;<i>he</i>
isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; O, how shall I dare meet father!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And disclosing to me her tear-stained face, and opening her arms
with a tragic gesture: &lsquo;And I am quite disgraced before all
the young ladies, my school-companions!&rsquo; she added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, not so bad as that!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, come, you exaggerate, my dear Miss&mdash;?&nbsp;
Excuse me if I am too familiar: I have not yet heard your
name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name is Dorothy Greensleeves, sir: why should I
conceal it?&nbsp; I fear it will only serve to point an adage to
future generations, and I had meant so differently!&nbsp; There
was no young female in the county more emulous to be thought well
of than I.&nbsp; And what a fall was there!&nbsp; O, dear me,
what a wicked, piggish donkey of a girl I have made of myself, to
be sure!&nbsp; And there is no hope! O, Mr.&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And at that she paused and asked my name.</p>
<p>I am not writing my eulogium for the Academy; I will admit it
was unpardonably imbecile, but I told it her.&nbsp; If you had
been there&mdash;and seen her, ravishingly pretty and little, a
baby in years and mind&mdash;and heard her talking like a book,
with so much of schoolroom propriety in her manner, with such an
innocent despair in the matter&mdash;you would probably have told
her yours.&nbsp; She repeated it after me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall pray for you all my life,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Every night, when I retire to rest, the last
thing I shall do is to remember you by name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Presently I succeeded in winning from her her tale, which was
much what I had anticipated: a tale of a schoolhouse, a walled
garden, a fruit-tree that concealed a bench, an impudent raff
posturing in church, an exchange of flowers and vows over the
garden wall, a silly schoolmate for a confidante, a chaise and
four, and the most immediate and perfect disenchantment on the
part of the little lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;And there is nothing to be
done!&rsquo; she wailed in conclusion.&nbsp; &lsquo;My error is
irretrievable, I am quite forced to that conclusion.&nbsp; O,
Monsieur de Saint-Yves! who would have thought that I could have
been such a blind, wicked donkey!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I should have said before&mdash;only that I really do not know
when it came in&mdash;that we had been overtaken by the two
post-boys, Rowley and Mr. Bellamy, which was the hawbuck&rsquo;s
name, bestriding the four post-horses; and that these formed a
sort of cavalry escort, riding now before, now behind the chaise,
and Bellamy occasionally posturing at the window and obliging us
with some of his conversation.&nbsp; He was so ill-received that
I declare I was tempted to pity him, remembering from what a
height he had fallen, and how few hours ago it was since the lady
had herself fled to his arms, all blushes and ardour.&nbsp; Well,
these great strokes of fortune usually befall the unworthy, and
Bellamy was now the legitimate object of my commiseration and the
ridicule of his own post-boys!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Dorothy,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you wish to be
delivered from this man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, if it were possible!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But not by violence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in the least, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The simplest thing in life.&nbsp; We are in a civilised
country; the man&rsquo;s a malefactor&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, never!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do not even
dream it!&nbsp; With all his faults, I know he is not
<i>that</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anyway, he&rsquo;s in the wrong in this affair&mdash;on
the wrong side of the law, call it what you please,&rsquo; said
I; and with that, our four horsemen having for the moment headed
us by a considerable interval, I hailed my post-boy and inquired
who was the nearest magistrate and where he lived.&nbsp;
Archdeacon Clitheroe, he told me, a prodigious dignitary, and one
who lived but a lane or two back, and at the distance of only a
mile or two out of the direct road.&nbsp; I showed him the
king&rsquo;s medallion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take the lady there, and at full gallop,&rsquo; I
cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right, sir!&nbsp; Mind yourself,&rsquo; says the
postillion.</p>
<p>And before I could have thought it possible, he had turned the
carriage to the rightabout and we were galloping south.</p>
<p>Our outriders were quick to remark and imitate the manoeuvre,
and came flying after us with a vast deal of indiscriminate
shouting; so that the fine, sober picture of a carriage and
escort, that we had presented but a moment back, was transformed
in the twinkling of an eye into the image of a noisy
fox-chase.&nbsp; The two postillions and my own saucy rogue were,
of course, disinterested actors in the comedy; they rode for the
mere sport, keeping in a body, their mouths full of laughter,
waving their hats as they came on, and crying (as the fancy
struck them) Tally-ho!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop,
thief!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A highwayman!&nbsp; A
highwayman!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was otherguess work with
Bellamy.&nbsp; That gentleman no sooner observed our change of
direction than he turned his horse with so much violence that the
poor animal was almost cast upon its side, and launched her in
immediate and desperate pursuit.&nbsp; As he approached I saw
that his face was deadly white and that he carried a drawn pistol
in his hand.&nbsp; I turned at once to the poor little bride that
was to have been, and now was not to be; she, upon her side,
deserting the other window, turned as if to meet me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, O, don&rsquo;t let him kill me!&rsquo; she
screamed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>Her face was distorted with terror.&nbsp; Her hands took hold
upon me with the instinctive clutch of an infant.&nbsp; The
chaise gave a flying lurch, which took the feet from under me and
tumbled us anyhow upon the seat.&nbsp; And almost in the same
moment the head of Bellamy appeared in the window which Missy had
left free for him.</p>
<p>Conceive the situation!&nbsp; The little lady and I were
falling&mdash;or had just fallen&mdash;backward on the seat, and
offered to the eye a somewhat ambiguous picture.&nbsp; The chaise
was speeding at a furious pace, and with the most violent leaps
and lurches, along the highway.&nbsp; Into this bounding
receptacle Bellamy interjected his head, his pistol arm, and his
pistol; and since his own horse was travelling still faster than
the chaise, he must withdraw all of them again in the inside of
the fraction of a minute.&nbsp; He did so, but he left the charge
of the pistol behind him&mdash;whether by design or accident I
shall never know, and I dare say he has forgotten!&nbsp; Probably
he had only meant to threaten, in hopes of causing us to arrest
our flight.&nbsp; In the same moment came the explosion and a
pitiful cry from Missy; and my gentleman, making certain he had
struck her, went down the road pursued by the furies, turned at
the first corner, took a flying leap over the thorn hedge, and
disappeared across country in the least possible time.</p>
<p>Rowley was ready and eager to pursue; but I withheld him,
thinking we were excellently quit of Mr. Bellamy, at no more cost
than a scratch on the forearm and a bullet-hole in the left-hand
claret-coloured panel.&nbsp; And accordingly, but now at a more
decent pace, we proceeded on our way to Archdeacon
Clitheroe&rsquo;s, Missy&rsquo;s gratitude and admiration were
aroused to a high pitch by this dramatic scene, and what she was
pleased to call my wound.&nbsp; She must dress it for me with her
handkerchief, a service which she rendered me even with
tears.&nbsp; I could well have spared them, not loving on the
whole to be made ridiculous, and the injury being in the nature
of a cat&rsquo;s scratch.&nbsp; Indeed, I would have suggested
for her kind care rather the cure of my coat-sleeve, which had
suffered worse in the encounter; but I was too wise to risk the
anti-climax.&nbsp; That she had been rescued by a hero, that the
hero should have been wounded in the affray, and his wound
bandaged with her handkerchief (which it could not even bloody),
ministered incredibly to the recovery of her self-respect; and I
could hear her relate the incident to &lsquo;the young ladies, my
school-companions,&rsquo; in the most approved manner of Mrs.
Radcliffe!&nbsp; To have insisted on the torn coat-sleeve would
have been unmannerly, if not inhuman.</p>
<p>Presently the residence of the archdeacon began to heave in
sight.&nbsp; A chaise and four smoking horses stood by the steps,
and made way for us on our approach; and even as we alighted
there appeared from the interior of the house a tall
ecclesiastic, and beside him a little, headstrong, ruddy man, in
a towering passion, and brandishing over his head a roll of
paper.&nbsp; At sight of him Miss Dorothy flung herself on her
knees with the most moving adjurations, calling him father,
assuring him she was wholly cured and entirely repentant of her
disobedience, and entreating forgiveness; and I soon saw that she
need fear no great severity from Mr. Greensleeves, who showed
himself extraordinarily fond, loud, greedy of caresses and
prodigal of tears.</p>
<p>To give myself a countenance, as well as to have all ready for
the road when I should find occasion, I turned to quit scores
with Bellamy&rsquo;s two postillions.&nbsp; They had not the
least claim on me, but one of which they were quite
ignorant&mdash;that I was a fugitive.&nbsp; It is the worst
feature of that false position that every gratuity becomes a case
of conscience.&nbsp; You must not leave behind you any one
discontented nor any one grateful.&nbsp; But the whole business
had been such a &lsquo;hurrah-boys&rsquo; from the beginning, and
had gone off in the fifth act so like a melodrama, in explosions,
reconciliations, and the rape of a post-horse, that it was
plainly impossible to keep it covered.&nbsp; It was plain it
would have to be talked over in all the inn-kitchens for thirty
miles about, and likely for six months to come.&nbsp; It only
remained for me, therefore, to settle on that gratuity which
should be least conspicuous&mdash;so large that nobody could
grumble, so small that nobody would be tempted to boast.&nbsp; My
decision was hastily and nor wisely taken.&nbsp; The one fellow
spat on his tip (so he called it) for luck; the other developing
a sudden streak of piety, prayed God bless me with fervour.&nbsp;
It seemed a demonstration was brewing, and I determined to be off
at once.&nbsp; Bidding my own post-boy and Rowley be in readiness
for an immediate start, I reascended the terrace and presented
myself, hat in hand, before Mr. Greensleeves and the
archdeacon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will excuse me, I trust,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think shame to interrupt this agreeable scene of family
effusion, which I have been privileged in some small degree to
bring about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And at these words the storm broke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Small degree! small degree, sir!&rsquo; cries the
father; &lsquo;that shall not pass, Mr. St. Eaves!&nbsp; If
I&rsquo;ve got my darling back, and none the worse for that
vagabone rascal, I know whom I have to thank.&nbsp; Shake hands
with me&mdash;up to the elbows, sir!&nbsp; A Frenchman you may
be, but you&rsquo;re one of the right breed, by God!&nbsp; And,
by God, sir, you may have anything you care to ask of me, down to
Dolly&rsquo;s hand, by God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All this he roared out in a voice surprisingly powerful from
so small a person.&nbsp; Every word was thus audible to the
servants, who had followed them out of the house and now
congregated about us on the terrace, as well as to Rowley and the
five postillions on the gravel sweep below.&nbsp; The sentiments
expressed were popular; some ass, whom the devil moved to be my
enemy, proposed three cheers, and they were given with a
will.&nbsp; To hear my own name resounding amid acclamations in
the hills of Westmorland was flattering, perhaps; but it was
inconvenient at a moment when (as I was morally persuaded) police
handbills were already speeding after me at the rate of a hundred
miles a day.</p>
<p>Nor was that the end of it.&nbsp; The archdeacon must present
his compliments, and pressed upon me some of his West India
sherry, and I was carried into a vastly fine library, where I was
presented to his lady wife.&nbsp; While we were at sherry in the
library, ale was handed round upon the terrace.&nbsp; Speeches
were made, hands were shaken, Missy (at her father&rsquo;s
request) kissed me farewell, and the whole party reaccompanied me
to the terrace, where they stood waving hats and handkerchiefs,
and crying farewells to all the echoes of the mountains until the
chaise had disappeared.</p>
<p>The echoes of the mountains were engaged in saying to me
privately: &lsquo;You fool, you have done it now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They do seem to have got &rsquo;old of your name, Mr.
Anne,&rsquo; said Rowley.&nbsp; &lsquo;It weren&rsquo;t my fault
this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was one of those accidents that can never be
foreseen,&rsquo; said I, affecting a dignity that I was far from
feeling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some one recognised me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which on &rsquo;em, Mr. Anne?&rsquo; said the
rascal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a senseless question; it can make no difference
who it was,&rsquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, nor that it can&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried Rowley.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I say, Mr. Anne, sir, it&rsquo;s what you would call a
jolly mess, ain&rsquo;t it? looks like &ldquo;clean bowled-out in
the middle stump,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fail to understand you, Rowley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what I mean is, what are we to do about this
one?&rsquo; pointing to the postillion in front of us, as he
alternately hid and revealed his patched breeches to the trot of
his horse.&nbsp; &lsquo;He see you get in this morning under
<i>Mr. Ramornie</i>&mdash;I was very piticular to <i>Mr.
Ramornie</i> you, if you remember, sir&mdash;and he see you get
in again under Mr. Saint Eaves, and whatever&rsquo;s he going to
see you get out under? that&rsquo;s what worries me, sir.&nbsp;
It don&rsquo;t seem to me like as if the position was what you
call <i>stratetegic</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Parrrbleu</i>! will you let me be!&rsquo; I
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have to think; you cannot imagine how your
constant idiotic prattle annoys me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg pardon, Mr. Anne,&rsquo; said he; and the next
moment, &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like for us to do our French
now, would you, Mr. Anne?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Play upon
your flageolet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The which he did with what seemed to me to be irony.</p>
<p>Conscience doth make cowards of us all!&nbsp; I was so
downcast by my pitiful mismanagement of the morning&rsquo;s
business that I shrank from the eye of my own hired infant, and
read offensive meanings into his idle tootling.</p>
<p>I took off my coat, and set to mending it, soldier-fashion,
with a needle and thread.&nbsp; There is nothing more conducive
to thought, above all in arduous circumstances; and as I sewed, I
gradually gained a clearness upon my affairs.&nbsp; I must be
done with the claret-coloured chaise at once.&nbsp; It should be
sold at the next stage for what it would bring.&nbsp; Rowley and
I must take back to the road on our four feet, and after a decent
interval of trudging, get places on some coach for Edinburgh
again under new names!&nbsp; So much trouble and toil, so much
extra risk and expense and loss of time, and all for a slip of
the tongue to a little lady in blue!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;THE INN-KEEPER OF KIRKBY-LONSDALE</h2>
<p>I had hitherto conceived and partly carried out an ideal that
was dear to my heart.&nbsp; Rowley and I descended from our
claret-coloured chaise, a couple of correctly dressed, brisk,
bright-eyed young fellows, like a pair of aristocratic mice;
attending singly to our own affairs, communicating solely with
each other, and that with the niceties and civilities of
drill.&nbsp; We would pass through the little crowd before the
door with high-bred preoccupation, inoffensively haughty, after
the best English pattern; and disappear within, followed by the
envy and admiration of the bystanders, a model master and
servant, point-device in every part.&nbsp; It was a heavy thought
to me, as we drew up before the inn at Kirkby-Lonsdale, that this
scene was now to be enacted for the last time.&nbsp; Alas! and
had I known it, it was to go of with so inferior a grace!</p>
<p>I had been injudiciously liberal to the post-boys of the
chaise and four.&nbsp; My own post-boy, he of the patched
breeches, now stood before me, his eyes glittering with greed,
his hand advanced.&nbsp; It was plain he anticipated something
extraordinary by way of a <i>pourboire</i>; and considering the
marches and counter-marches by which I had extended the stage,
the military character of our affairs with Mr. Bellamy, and the
bad example I had set before him at the archdeacon&rsquo;s,
something exceptional was certainly to be done.&nbsp; But these
are always nice questions, to a foreigner above all: a shade too
little will suggest niggardliness, a shilling too much smells of
hush-money.&nbsp; Fresh from the scene at the archdeacon&rsquo;s,
and flushed by the idea that I was now nearly done with the
responsibilities of the claret-coloured chaise, I put into his
hands five guineas; and the amount served only to waken his
cupidity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, come, sir, you ain&rsquo;t going to fob me of with
this?&nbsp; Why, I seen fire at your side!&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>It would never do to give him more; I felt I should become the
fable of Kirkby-Lonsdale if I did; and I looked him in the face,
sternly but still smiling, and addressed him with a voice of
uncompromising firmness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you do not like it, give it back,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>He pocketed the guineas with the quickness of a conjurer, and,
like a base-born cockney as he was, fell instantly to casting
dirt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ave your own way of it, Mr.
Ramornie&mdash;leastways Mr. St. Eaves, or whatever your blessed
name may be.&nbsp; Look &rsquo;ere&rsquo;&mdash;turning for
sympathy to the stable-boys&mdash;&lsquo;this is a blessed
business.&nbsp; Blessed &rsquo;ard, I calls it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere
I takes up a blessed son of a pop-gun what calls hisself anything
you care to mention, and turns out to be a blessed
<i>mounseer</i> at the end of it!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere &rsquo;ave I
been drivin&rsquo; of him up and down all day, a-carrying off of
gals, a-shootin&rsquo; of pistyils, and a-drinkin&rsquo; of
sherry and hale; and wot does he up and give me but a blank,
blank, blanketing blank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fellow&rsquo;s language had become too powerful for
reproduction, and I passed it by.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I observed Rowley fretting visibly at the bit;
another moment, and he would have added a last touch of the
ridiculous to our arrival by coming to his hands with the
postillion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rowley!&rsquo; cried I reprovingly.</p>
<p>Strictly it should have been Gammon; but in the hurry of the
moment, my fault (I can only hope) passed unperceived.&nbsp; At
the same time I caught the eye of the postmaster.&nbsp; He was
long and lean, and brown and bilious; he had the drooping nose of
the humourist, and the quick attention of a man of parts.&nbsp;
He read my embarrassment in a glance, stepped instantly forward,
sent the post-boy to the rightabout with half a word, and was
back next moment at my side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dinner in a private room, sir?&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp;
John, No. 4!&nbsp; What wine would you care to mention?&nbsp;
Very well, sir.&nbsp; Will you please to order fresh
horses?&nbsp; Not, sir?&nbsp; Very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Each of these expressions was accompanied by something in the
nature of a bow, and all were prefaced by something in the nature
of a smile, which I could very well have done without.&nbsp; The
man&rsquo;s politeness was from the teeth outwards; behind and
within, I was conscious of a perpetual scrutiny: the scene at his
doorstep, the random confidences of the post-boy, had not been
thrown away on this observer; and it was under a strong fear of
coming trouble that I was shown at last into my private
room.&nbsp; I was in half a mind to have put off the whole
business.&nbsp; But the truth is, now my name had got abroad, my
fear of the mail that was coming, and the handbills it should
contain, had waxed inordinately, and I felt I could never eat a
meal in peace till I had severed my connection with the
claret-coloured chaise.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as soon as I had done with dinner, I sent my
compliments to the landlord and requested he should take a glass
of wine with me.&nbsp; He came; we exchanged the necessary
civilities, and presently I approached my business.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the bye,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;we had a brush down
the road to-day.&nbsp; I dare say you may have heard of
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I was so unlucky as to get a pistol ball in the
panel of my chaise,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;which makes it
simply useless to me.&nbsp; Do you know any one likely to
buy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can well understand that,&rsquo; said the landlord,
&lsquo;I was looking at it just now; it&rsquo;s as good as
ruined, is that chaise.&nbsp; General rule, people don&rsquo;t
like chaises with bullet-holes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too much <i>Romance of the Forest</i>?&rsquo; I
suggested, recalling my little friend of the morning, and what I
was sure had been her favourite reading&mdash;Mrs.
Radcliffe&rsquo;s novels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;They may be
right, they may be wrong; I&rsquo;m not the judge.&nbsp; But I
suppose it&rsquo;s natural, after all, for respectable people to
like things respectable about them; not bullet-holes, nor puddles
of blood, nor men with aliases.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I took a glass of wine and held it up to the light to show
that my hand was steady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I suppose so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have papers, of course, showing you are the proper
owner?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is the bill, stamped and receipted,&rsquo; said
I, tossing it across to him.</p>
<p>He looked at it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This all you have?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is enough, at least,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
shows you where I bought and what I paid for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You want some paper of identification.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To identify the chaise?&rsquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all: to identify <i>you</i>,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good sir, remember yourself!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The title-deeds of my estate are in that despatch-box; but
you do not seriously suppose that I should allow you to examine
them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you see, this paper proves that some Mr. Ramornie
paid seventy guineas for a chaise,&rsquo; said the fellow.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all well and good; but who&rsquo;s to prove
to me that you are Mr. Ramornie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fellow!&rsquo; cried I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, fellow as much as you please!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fellow, with all my heart!&nbsp; That changes
nothing.&nbsp; I am fellow, of course&mdash;obtrusive fellow,
impudent fellow, if you like&mdash;but who are you?&nbsp; I hear
of you with two names; I hear of you running away with young
ladies, and getting cheered for a Frenchman, which seems odd; and
one thing I will go bail for, that you were in a blue fright when
the post-boy began to tell tales at my door.&nbsp; In short, sir,
you may be a very good gentleman; but I don&rsquo;t know enough
about you, and I&rsquo;ll trouble you for your papers, or to go
before a magistrate.&nbsp; Take your choice; if I&rsquo;m not
fine enough, I hope the magistrates are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good man,&rsquo; I stammered, for though I had found
my voice, I could scarce be said to have recovered my wits,
&lsquo;this is most unusual, most rude.&nbsp; Is it the custom in
Westmorland that gentlemen should be insulted?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That depends,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;When
it&rsquo;s suspected that gentlemen are spies it <i>is</i> the
custom; and a good custom, too.&nbsp; No no,&rsquo; he broke out,
perceiving me to make a movement.&nbsp; &lsquo;Both hands upon
the table, my gentleman!&nbsp; I want no pistol balls in my
chaise panels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely, sir, you do me strange injustice!&rsquo; said
I, now the master of myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see me sitting
here, a monument of tranquillity: pray may I help myself to wine
without umbraging you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I took this attitude in sheer despair.&nbsp; I had no plan, no
hope.&nbsp; The best I could imagine was to spin the business out
some minutes longer, then capitulate.&nbsp; At least, I would not
capituatle one moment too soon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I to take that for <i>no</i>?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Referring to your former obliging proposal?&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;My good sir, you are to take it, as you say, for
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly I will not show you my deeds;
certainly I will not rise from table and trundle out to see your
magistrates.&nbsp; I have too much respect for my digestion, and
too little curiosity in justices of the peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward, looked me nearly in the face, and reached
out one hand to the bell-rope.&nbsp; &lsquo;See here, my fine
fellow!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you see that
bell-rope?&nbsp; Let me tell you, there&rsquo;s a boy waiting
below: one jingle, and he goes to fetch the constable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you tell me so?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
there&rsquo;s no accounting for tastes!&nbsp; I have a prejudice
against the society of constables, but if it is your fancy to
have one in for the dessert&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; I shrugged my
shoulders lightly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Really, you know,&rsquo; I added,
&lsquo;this is vastly entertaining.&nbsp; I assure you, I am
looking on, with all the interest of a man of the world, at the
development of your highly original character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He continued to study my face without speech, his hand still
on the button of the bell-rope, his eyes in mine; this was the
decisive heat.&nbsp; My face seemed to myself to dislimn under
his gaze, my expression to change, the smile (with which I had
began) to degenerate into the grin of the man upon the
rack.&nbsp; I was besides harassed with doubts.&nbsp; An innocent
man, I argued, would have resented the fellow&rsquo;s impudence
an hour ago; and by my continued endurance of the ordeal, I was
simply signing and sealing my confession; in short, I had reached
the end of my powers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you any objection to my putting my hands in my
breeches pockets?&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;Excuse me
mentioning it, but you showed yourself so extremely nervous a
moment back.&rsquo;&nbsp; My voice was not all I could have
wished, but it sufficed.&nbsp; I could hear it tremble, but the
landlord apparently could not.&nbsp; He turned away and drew a
long breath, and you may be sure I was quick to follow his
example.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a cool hand at least, and that&rsquo;s the
sort I like,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be you what you please,
I&rsquo;ll deal square.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take the chaise for a
hundred pound down, and throw the dinner in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; I cried, wholly mystified by
this form of words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You pay me a hundred down,&rsquo; he repeated,
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll take the chaise.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
little more than it cost,&rsquo; he added, with a grin,
&lsquo;and you know you must get it off your hands
somehow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I do not know when I have been better entertained than by this
impudent proposal.&nbsp; It was broadly funny, and I suppose the
least tempting offer in the world.&nbsp; For all that, it came
very welcome, for it gave me the occasion to laugh.&nbsp; This I
did with the most complete abandonment, till the tears ran down
my cheeks; and ever and again, as the fit abated, I would get
another view of the landlord&rsquo;s face, and go off into
another paroxysm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You droll creature, you will be the death of me
yet!&rsquo; I cried, drying my eyes.</p>
<p>My friend was now wholly disconcerted; he knew not where to
look, nor yet what to say; and began for the first time to
conceive it possible he was mistaken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem rather to enjoy a laugh, sir,&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, yes!&nbsp; I am quite an original,&rsquo; I replied,
and laughed again.</p>
<p>Presently, in a changed voice, he offered me twenty pounds for
the chaise; I ran him up to twenty-five, and closed with the
offer: indeed, I was glad to get anything; and if I haggled, it
was not in the desire of gain, but with the view at any price of
securing a safe retreat.&nbsp; For although hostilities were
suspended, he was yet far from satisfied; and I could read his
continued suspicions in the cloudy eye that still hovered about
my face.&nbsp; At last they took shape in words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is all very well,&rsquo; says he: &lsquo;you carry
it off well; but for all that, I must do my duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had my strong effect in reserve; it was to burn my ships
with a vengeance!&nbsp; I rose.&nbsp; &lsquo;Leave the
room,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is insuperable.&nbsp; Is
the man mad?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, as if already half-ashamed of
my passion: &lsquo;I can take a joke as well as any one,&rsquo; I
added; &lsquo;but this passes measure.&nbsp; Send my servant and
the bill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he had left me alone, I considered my own valour with
amazement.&nbsp; I had insulted him; I had sent him away alone;
now, if ever, he would take what was the only sensible resource,
and fetch the constable.&nbsp; But there was something
instinctively treacherous about the man which shrank from plain
courses.&nbsp; And, with all his cleverness, he missed the
occasion of fame.&nbsp; Rowley and I were suffered to walk out of
his door, with all our baggage, on foot, with no destination
named, except in the vague statement that we were come &lsquo;to
view the lakes&rsquo;; and my friend only watched our departure
with his chin in his hand, still moodily irresolute.</p>
<p>I think this one of my great successes.&nbsp; I was exposed,
unmasked, summoned to do a perfectly natural act, which must
prove my doom and which I had not the slightest pretext for
refusing.&nbsp; I kept my head, stuck to my guns, and, against
all likelihood, here I was once more at liberty and in the
king&rsquo;s highway.&nbsp; This was a strong lesson never to
despair; and, at the same time, how many hints to be cautious!
and what a perplexed and dubious business the whole question of
my escape now appeared!&nbsp; That I should have risked perishing
upon a trumpery question of a <i>pourboire</i>, depicted in
lively colours the perils that perpetually surrounded us.&nbsp;
Though, to be sure, the initial mistake had been committed before
that; and if I had not suffered myself to be drawn a little deep
in confidences to the innocent Dolly, there need have been no
tumble at the inn of Kirkby-Lonsdale.&nbsp; I took the lesson to
heart, and promised myself in the future to be more
reserved.&nbsp; It was none of my business to attend to broken
chaises or shipwrecked travellers.&nbsp; I had my hands full of
my own affairs; and my best defence would be a little more
natural selfishness and a trifle less imbecile good-nature.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV&mdash;I MEET A CHEERFUL EXTRAVAGANT</h2>
<p>I pass over the next fifty or sixty leagues of our journey
without comment.&nbsp; The reader must be growing weary of scenes
of travel; and for my own part I have no cause to recall these
particular miles with any pleasure.&nbsp; We were mainly occupied
with attempts to obliterate our trail, which (as the result
showed) were far from successful; for, on my cousin following, he
was able to run me home with the least possible loss of time,
following the claret-coloured chaise to Kirkby-Lonsdale, where I
think the landlord must have wept to learn what he had missed,
and tracing us thereafter to the doors of the coach-office in
Edinburgh without a single check.&nbsp; Fortune did not favour
me, and why should I recapitulate the details of futile
precautions which deceived nobody, and wearisome arts which
proved to be artless?</p>
<p>The day was drawing to an end when Mr. Rowley and I bowled
into Edinburgh to the stirring sound of the guard&rsquo;s bugle
and the clattering team.&nbsp; I was here upon my field of
battle; on the scene of my former captivity, escape and exploits;
and in the same city with my love.&nbsp; My heart expanded; I
have rarely felt more of a hero.&nbsp; All down the Bridges I sat
by the driver with my arms folded and my face set, unflinchingly
meeting every eye, and prepared every moment for a cry of
recognition.&nbsp; Hundreds of the population were in the habit
of visiting the Castle, where it was my practice (before the days
of Flora) to make myself conspicuous among the prisoners; and I
think it an extraordinary thing that I should have encountered so
few to recognise me.&nbsp; But doubtless a clean chin is a
disguise in itself; and the change is great from a suit of
sulphur-yellow to fine linen, a well-fitting mouse-coloured
great-coat furred in black, a pair of tight trousers of
fashionable cut, and a hat of inimitable curl.&nbsp; After all,
it was more likely that I should have recognised our visitors,
than that they should have identified the modish gentleman with
the miserable prisoner in the Castle.</p>
<p>I was glad to set foot on the flagstones, and to escape from
the crowd that had assembled to receive the mail.&nbsp; Here we
were, with but little daylight before us, and that on Saturday
afternoon, the eve of the famous Scottish Sabbath, adrift in the
New Town of Edinburgh, and overladen with baggage.&nbsp; We
carried it ourselves.&nbsp; I would not take a cab, nor so much
as hire a porter, who might afterwards serve as a link between my
lodgings and the mail, and connect me again with the
claret-coloured chaise and Aylesbury.&nbsp; For I was resolved to
break the chain of evidence for good, and to begin life afresh
(so far as regards caution) with a new character.&nbsp; The first
step was to find lodgings, and to find them quickly.&nbsp; This
was the more needful as Mr. Rowley and I, in our smart clothes
and with our cumbrous burthen, made a noticeable appearance in
the streets at that time of the day and in that quarter of the
town, which was largely given up to fine folk, bucks and dandies
and young ladies, or respectable professional men on their way
home to dinner.</p>
<p>On the north side of St. James&rsquo; Square I was so happy as
to spy a bill in a third-floor window.&nbsp; I was equally
indifferent to cost and convenience in my choice of a
lodging&mdash;&lsquo;any port in a storm&rsquo; was the principle
on which I was prepared to act; and Rowley and I made at once for
the common entrance and sealed the stair.</p>
<p>We were admitted by a very sour-looking female in
bombazine.&nbsp; I gathered she had all her life been depressed
by a series of bereavements, the last of which might very well
have befallen her the day before; and I instinctively lowered my
voice when I addressed her.&nbsp; She admitted she had rooms to
let&mdash;even showed them to us&mdash;a sitting-room and bedroom
in a <i>suite</i>, commanding a fine prospect to the Firth and
Fifeshire, and in themselves well proportioned and comfortably
furnished, with pictures on the wall, shells on the mantelpiece,
and several books upon the table which I found afterwards to be
all of a devotional character, and all presentation copies,
&lsquo;to my Christian friend,&rsquo; or &lsquo;to my devout
acquaintance in the Lord, Bethiah McRankine.&rsquo;&nbsp; Beyond
this my &lsquo;Christian friend&rsquo; could not be made to
advance: no, not even to do that which seemed the most natural
and pleasing thing in the world&mdash;I mean to name her
price&mdash;but stood before us shaking her head, and at times
mourning like the dove, the picture of depression and
defence.&nbsp; She had a voice the most querulous I have ever
heard, and with this she produced a whole regiment of
difficulties and criticisms.</p>
<p>She could not promise an attendance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, madam,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and what is my
servant for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Him?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be gude to
us!&nbsp; Is <i>he</i> your servant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry, ma&rsquo;am, he meets with your
disapproval.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Na, I never said that.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s
young.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be a great breaker, I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Ay! he&rsquo;ll be a great responsibeelity
to ye, like.&nbsp; Does he attend to his releegion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, m&rsquo;m,&rsquo; returned Rowley, with admirable
promptitude, and, immediately closing his eyes, as if from habit,
repeated the following distich with more celerity than
fervour:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Matthew, Mark, Luke and John<br />
Bless the bed that I lie on!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Nhm!&rsquo; said the lady, and maintained an awful
silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it seems we
are never to hear the beginning of your terms, let alone the end
of them.&nbsp; Come&mdash;a good movement! and let us be either
off or on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She opened her lips slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ony
raferences?&rsquo; she inquired, in a voice like a bell.</p>
<p>I opened my pocket-book and showed her a handful of bank
bills.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think, madam, that these are
unexceptionable,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; breakfast late?&rsquo; was
her reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam, we want breakfast at whatever hour it suits you
to give it, from four in the morning till four in the
afternoon!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only tell us your figure,
if your mouth be large enough to let it out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldnae give ye supper the nicht,&rsquo; came the
echo.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall go out to supper, you incorrigible
female!&rsquo; I vowed, between laughter and tears.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here&mdash;this is going to end!&nbsp; I want you for a
landlady&mdash;let me tell you that!&mdash;and I am going to have
my way.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t tell me what you charge?&nbsp; Very
well; I will do without!&nbsp; I can trust you!&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t seem to know when you have a good lodger; but I know
perfectly when I have an honest landlady!&nbsp; Rowley, unstrap
the valises!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Will it be credited?&nbsp; The monomaniac fell to rating me
for my indiscretion!&nbsp; But the battle was over; these were
her last guns, and more in the nature of a salute than of renewed
hostilities.&nbsp; And presently she condescended on very
moderate terms, and Rowley and I were able to escape in quest of
supper.&nbsp; Much time had, however, been lost; the sun was long
down, the lamps glimmered along the streets, and the voice of a
watchman already resounded in the neighbouring Leith Road.&nbsp;
On our first arrival I had observed a place of entertainment not
far off, in a street behind the Register House.&nbsp; Thither we
found our way, and sat down to a late dinner alone.&nbsp; But we
had scarce given our orders before the door opened, and a tall
young fellow entered with something of a lurch, looked about him,
and approached the same table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give you good evening, most grave and reverend
seniors!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you permit a wanderer,
a pilgrim&mdash;the pilgrim of love, in short&mdash;to come to
temporary anchor under your lee?&nbsp; I care not who knows it,
but I have a passionate aversion from the bestial practice of
solitary feeding!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are welcome, sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if I may
take upon me so far to play the host in a public
place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked startled, and fixed a hazy eye on me, as he sat
down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are a man not without
some tincture of letters, I perceive!&nbsp; What shall we drink,
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I mentioned I had already called for a pot of porter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A modest pot&mdash;the seasonable quencher?&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I do not know but what I could look at a
modest pot myself!&nbsp; I am, for the moment, in precarious
health.&nbsp; Much study hath heated my brain, much walking
wearied my&mdash;well, it seems to be more my eyes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have walked far, I dare say?&rsquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so much far as often,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is in this city&mdash;to which, I think, you are a
stranger?&nbsp; Sir, to your very good health and our better
acquaintance!&mdash;there is, in this city of Dunedin, a certain
implication of streets which reflects the utmost credit on the
designer and the publicans&mdash;at every hundred yards is seated
the Judicious Tavern, so that persons of contemplative mind are
secure, at moderate distances, of refreshment.&nbsp; I have been
doing a trot in that favoured quarter, favoured by art and
nature.&nbsp; A few chosen comrades&mdash;enemies of publicity
and friends to wit and wine&mdash;obliged me with their
society.&nbsp; &ldquo;Along the cool, sequestered vale of
Register Street we kept the uneven tenor of our way,&rdquo;
sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It struck me, as you came in&mdash;&rsquo; I began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t make any bones about it!&rsquo; he
interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course it struck you! and let me
tell you I was devilish lucky not to strike myself.&nbsp; When I
entered this apartment I shone &ldquo;with all the pomp and
prodigality of brandy and water,&rdquo; as the poet Gray has in
another place expressed it.&nbsp; Powerful bard, Gray! but a
niminy-piminy creature, afraid of a petticoat and a
bottle&mdash;not a man, sir, not a man!&nbsp; Excuse me for being
so troublesome, but what the devil have I done with my
fork?&nbsp; Thank you, I am sure.&nbsp; <i>Temulentia</i>,
<i>quoad me ipsum</i>, <i>brevis colligo est</i>.&nbsp; I sit and
eat, sir, in a London fog.&nbsp; I should bring a link-boy to
table with me; and I would too, if the little brutes were only
washed!&nbsp; I intend to found a Philanthropical Society for
Washing the Deserving Poor and Shaving Soldiers.&nbsp; I am
pleased to observe that, although not of an unmilitary bearing,
you are apparently shaved.&nbsp; In my calendar of the virtues
shaving comes next to drinking.&nbsp; A gentleman may be a
low-minded ruffian without sixpence, but he will always be close
shaved.&nbsp; See me, with the eye of fancy, in the chill hours
of the morning, say about a quarter to twelve, noon&mdash;see me
awake!&nbsp; First thing of all, without one thought of the
plausible but unsatisfactory small beer, or the healthful though
insipid soda-water, I take the deadly razor in my vacillating
grasp; I proceed to skate upon the margin of eternity.&nbsp;
Stimulating thought!&nbsp; I bleed, perhaps, but with medicable
wounds.&nbsp; The stubble reaped, I pass out of my chamber, calm
but triumphant.&nbsp; To employ a hackneyed phrase, I would not
call Lord Wellington my uncle!&nbsp; I, too, have dared, perhaps
bled, before the imminent deadly shaving-table.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this manner the bombastic fellow continued to entertain me
all through dinner, and by a common error of drunkards, because
he had been extremely talkative himself, leaped to the conclusion
that he had chanced on very genial company.&nbsp; He told me his
name, his address; he begged we should meet again; finally he
proposed that I should dine with him in the country at an early
date.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The dinner is official,&rsquo; he explained.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The office-bearers and Senatus of the University of
Cramond&mdash;an educational institution in which I have the
honour to be Professor of Nonsense&mdash;meet to do honour to our
friend Icarus, at the old-established <i>howff</i>, Cramond
Bridge.&nbsp; One place is vacant, fascinating stranger,&mdash;I
offer it to you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who is your friend Icarus?&rsquo; I asked,</p>
<p>&lsquo;The aspiring son of Daedalus!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is it possible that you have never heard the name of
Byfield?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Possible and true,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is fame so small a thing?&rsquo; cried he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Byfield, sir, is an aeronaut.&nbsp; He apes the fame of a
Lunardi, and is on the point of offering to the
inhabitants&mdash;I beg your pardon, to the nobility and gentry
of our neighbourhood&mdash;the spectacle of an ascension.&nbsp;
As one of the gentry concerned I may be permitted to remark that
I am unmoved.&nbsp; I care not a Tinker&rsquo;s Damn for his
ascension.&nbsp; No more&mdash;I breathe it in your
ear&mdash;does anybody else.&nbsp; The business is stale, sir,
stale.&nbsp; Lunardi did it, and overdid it.&nbsp; A whimsical,
fiddling, vain fellow, by all accounts&mdash;for I was at that
time rocking in my cradle.&nbsp; But once was enough.&nbsp; If
Lunardi went up and came down, there was the matter
settled.&nbsp; We prefer to grant the point.&nbsp; We do not want
to see the experiment repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by Byfield, and
Brown, and Butler, and Brodie, and Bottomley.&nbsp; Ah! if they
would go up and <i>not</i> come down again!&nbsp; But this is by
the question.&nbsp; The University of Cramond delights to honour
merit in the man, sir, rather than utility in the profession; and
Byfield, though an ignorant dog, is a sound reliable drinker, and
really not amiss over his cups.&nbsp; Under the radiance of the
kindly jar partiality might even credit him with wit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It will be seen afterwards that this was more my business than
I thought it at the time.&nbsp; Indeed, I was impatient to be
gone.&nbsp; Even as my friend maundered ahead a squall burst, the
jaws of the rain were opened against the coffee-house windows,
and at that inclement signal I remembered I was due
elsewhere.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;THE COTTAGE AT NIGHT</h2>
<p>At the door I was nearly blown back by the unbridled violence
of the squall, and Rowley and I must shout our parting
words.&nbsp; All the way along Princes Street (whither my way
led) the wind hunted me behind and screamed in my ears.&nbsp; The
city was flushed with bucketfuls of rain that tasted salt from
the neighbouring ocean.&nbsp; It seemed to darken and lighten
again in the vicissitudes of the gusts.&nbsp; Now you would say
the lamps had been blown out from end to end of the long
thoroughfare; now, in a lull, they would revive, re-multiply,
shine again on the wet pavements, and make darkness sparingly
visible.</p>
<p>By the time I had got to the corner of the Lothian Road there
was a distinct improvement.&nbsp; For one thing, I had now my
shoulder to the wind; for a second, I came in the lee of my old
prison-house, the Castle; and, at any rate, the excessive fury of
the blast was itself moderating.&nbsp; The thought of what errand
I was on re-awoke within me, and I seemed to breast the rough
weather with increasing ease.&nbsp; With such a destination, what
mattered a little buffeting of wind or a sprinkle of cold
water?&nbsp; I recalled Flora&rsquo;s image, I took her in fancy
to my arms, and my heart throbbed.&nbsp; And the next moment I
had recognised the inanity of that fool&rsquo;s paradise.&nbsp;
If I could spy her taper as she went to bed, I might count myself
lucky.</p>
<p>I had about two leagues before me of a road mostly uphill, and
now deep in mire.&nbsp; So soon as I was clear of the last street
lamp, darkness received me&mdash;a darkness only pointed by the
lights of occasional rustic farms, where the dogs howled with
uplifted heads as I went by.&nbsp; The wind continued to decline:
it had been but a squall, not a tempest.&nbsp; The rain, on the
other hand, settled into a steady deluge, which had soon drenched
me thoroughly.&nbsp; I continued to tramp forward in the night,
contending with gloomy thoughts and accompanied by the dismal
ululation of the dogs.&nbsp; What ailed them that they should
have been thus wakeful, and perceived the small sound of my steps
amid the general reverberation of the rain, was more than I could
fancy.&nbsp; I remembered tales with which I had been entertained
in childhood.&nbsp; I told myself some murderer was going by, and
the brutes perceived upon him the faint smell of blood; and the
next moment, with a physical shock, I had applied the words to my
own case!</p>
<p>Here was a dismal disposition for a lover.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was
ever lady in this humour wooed?&rsquo; I asked myself, and came
near turning back.&nbsp; It is never wise to risk a critical
interview when your spirits are depressed, your clothes muddy,
and your hands wet!&nbsp; But the boisterous night was in itself
favourable to my enterprise: now, or perhaps never, I might find
some way to have an interview with Flora; and if I had one
interview (wet clothes, low spirits and all), I told myself there
would certainly be another.</p>
<p>Arrived in the cottage-garden I found the circumstances mighty
inclement.&nbsp; From the round holes in the shutters of the
parlour, shafts of candle-light streamed forth; elsewhere the
darkness was complete.&nbsp; The trees, the thickets, were
saturated; the lower parts of the garden turned into a
morass.&nbsp; At intervals, when the wind broke forth again,
there passed overhead a wild coil of clashing branches; and
between whiles the whole enclosure continuously and stridently
resounded with the rain.&nbsp; I advanced close to the window and
contrived to read the face of my watch.&nbsp; It was half-past
seven; they would not retire before ten, they might not before
midnight, and the prospect was unpleasant.&nbsp; In a lull of the
wind I could hear from the inside the voice of Flora reading
aloud; the words of course inaudible&mdash;only a flow of
undecipherable speech, quiet, cordial, colourless, more intimate
and winning, more eloquent of her personality, but not less
beautiful than song.&nbsp; And the next moment the clamour of a
fresh squall broke out about the cottage; the voice was drowned
in its bellowing, and I was glad to retreat from my dangerous
post.</p>
<p>For three egregious hours I must now suffer the elements to do
their worst upon me, and continue to hold my ground in
patience.&nbsp; I recalled the least fortunate of my services in
the field: being out-sentry of the pickets in weather no less
vile, sometimes unsuppered and with nothing to look forward to by
way of breakfast but musket-balls; and they seemed light in
comparison.&nbsp; So strangely are we built: so much more strong
is the love of woman than the mere love of life.</p>
<p>At last my patience was rewarded.&nbsp; The light disappeared
from the parlour and reappeared a moment after in the room
above.&nbsp; I was pretty well informed for the enterprise that
lay before me.&nbsp; I knew the lair of the dragon&mdash;that
which was just illuminated.&nbsp; I knew the bower of my
Rosamond, and how excellently it was placed on the ground-level,
round the flank of the cottage and out of earshot of her
formidable aunt.&nbsp; Nothing was left but to apply my
knowledge.&nbsp; I was then at the bottom of the garden, whether
I had gone (Heaven save the mark!) for warmth, that I might walk
to and fro unheard and keep myself from perishing.&nbsp; The
night had fallen still, the wind ceased; the noise of the rain
had much lightened, if it had not stopped, and was succeeded by
the dripping of the garden trees.&nbsp; In the midst of this
lull, and as I was already drawing near to the cottage, I was
startled by the sound of a window-sash screaming in its channels;
and a step or two beyond I became aware of a gush of light upon
the darkness.&nbsp; It fell from Flora&rsquo;s window, which she
had flung open on the night, and where she now sat, roseate and
pensive, in the shine of two candles falling from behind, her
tresses deeply embowering and shading her; the suspended comb
still in one hand, the other idly clinging to the iron stanchions
with which the window was barred.</p>
<p>Keeping to the turf, and favoured by the darkness of the night
and the patter of the rain which was now returning, though
without wind, I approached until I could almost have touched
her.&nbsp; It seemed a grossness of which I was incapable to
break up her reverie by speech.&nbsp; I stood and drank her in
with my eyes; how the light made a glory in her hair, and (what I
have always thought the most ravishing thing in nature) how the
planes ran into each other, and were distinguished, and how the
hues blended and varied, and were shaded off, between the cheek
and neck.&nbsp; At first I was abashed: she wore her beauty like
an immediate halo of refinement; she discouraged me like an
angel, or what I suspect to be the next most discouraging, a
modern lady.&nbsp; But as I continued to gaze, hope and life
returned to me; I forgot my timidity, I forgot the sickening pack
of wet clothes with which I stood burdened, I tingled with new
blood.</p>
<p>Still unconscious of my presence, still gazing before her upon
the illuminated image of the window, the straight shadows of the
bars, the glinting of pebbles on the path, and the impenetrable
night on the garden and the hills beyond it, she heaved a deep
breath that struck upon my heart like an appeal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why does Miss Gilchrist sigh?&rsquo; I whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Does she recall absent friends?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned her head swiftly in my direction; it was the only
sign of surprise she deigned to make.&nbsp; At the same time I
stepped into the light and bowed profoundly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am here,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
come very far, it may be a hundred and fifty leagues, to see
you.&nbsp; I have waited all this night in your garden.&nbsp;
Will Miss Gilchrist not offer her hand&mdash;to a friend in
trouble?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She extended it between the bars, and I dropped upon one knee
on the wet path and kissed it twice.&nbsp; At the second it was
withdrawn suddenly, methought with more of a start than she had
hitherto displayed.&nbsp; I regained my former attitude, and we
were both silent awhile.&nbsp; My timidity returned on me
tenfold.&nbsp; I looked in her face for any signals of anger, and
seeing her eyes to waver and fall aside from mine, augured that
all was well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must have been mad to come here!&rsquo; she broke
out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of all places under heaven this is no place for
you to come.&nbsp; And I was just thinking you were safe in
France!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were thinking of me!&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. St. Ives, you cannot understand your danger,&rsquo;
she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sure of it, and yet I cannot find
it in my heart to tell you.&nbsp; O, be persuaded, and
go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe I know the worst.&nbsp; But I was never one
to set an undue value on life, the life that we share with
beasts.&nbsp; My university has been in the wars, not a famous
place of education, but one where a man learns to carry his life
in his hand as lightly as a glove, and for his lady or his honour
to lay it as lightly down.&nbsp; You appeal to my fears, and you
do wrong.&nbsp; I have come to Scotland with my eyes quite open
to see you and to speak with you&mdash;it may be for the last
time.&nbsp; With my eyes quite open, I say; and if I did not
hesitate at the beginning do you think that I would draw back
now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not know!&rsquo; she cried, with rising
agitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;This country, even this garden, is death
to you.&nbsp; They all believe it; I am the only one that does
not.&nbsp; If they hear you now, if they heard a whisper&mdash;I
dread to think of it.&nbsp; O, go, go this instant.&nbsp; It is
my prayer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear lady, do not refuse me what I have come so far to
seek; and remember that out of all the millions in England there
is no other but yourself in whom I can dare confide.&nbsp; I have
all the world against me; you are my only ally; and as I have to
speak, you have to listen.&nbsp; All is true that they say of me,
and all of it false at the same time.&nbsp; I did kill this man
Goguelat&mdash;it was that you meant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She mutely signed to me that it was; she had become deadly
pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I killed him in fair fight.&nbsp; Till then, I had
never taken a life unless in battle, which is my trade.&nbsp; But
I was grateful, I was on fire with gratitude, to one who had been
good to me, who had been better to me than I could have dreamed
of an angel, who had come into the darkness of my prison like
sunrise.&nbsp; The man Goguelat insulted her.&nbsp; O, he had
insulted me often, it was his favourite pastime, and he might
insult me as he pleased&mdash;for who was I?&nbsp; But with that
lady it was different.&nbsp; I could never forgive myself if I
had let it pass.&nbsp; And we fought, and he fell, and I have no
remorse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I waited anxiously for some reply.&nbsp; The worst was now
out, and I knew that she had heard of it before; but it was
impossible for me to go on with my narrative without some shadow
of encouragement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You blame me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not at all.&nbsp; It is a point I cannot speak
on&mdash;I am only a girl.&nbsp; I am sure you were in the right:
I have always said so&mdash;to Ronald.&nbsp; Not, of course, to
my aunt.&nbsp; I am afraid I let her speak as she will.&nbsp; You
must not think me a disloyal friend; and even with the
Major&mdash;I did not tell you he had become quite a friend of
ours&mdash;Major Chevenix, I mean&mdash;he has taken such a fancy
to Ronald!&nbsp; It was he that brought the news to us of that
hateful Clausel being captured, and all that he was saying.&nbsp;
I was indignant with him.&nbsp; I said&mdash;I dare say I said
too much&mdash;and I must say he was very good-natured.&nbsp; He
said, &ldquo;You and I, who are his friends, <i>know</i> that
Champdivers is innocent.&nbsp; But what is the use of saying
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; All this was in the corner of the room in what
they call an aside.&nbsp; And then he said, &ldquo;Give me a
chance to speak to you in private, I have much to tell
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he did.&nbsp; And told me just what you
did&mdash;that it was an affair of honour, and no blame attached
to you.&nbsp; O, I must say I like that Major
Chevenix!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this I was seized with a great pang of jealousy.&nbsp; I
remembered the first time that he had seen her, the interest that
he seemed immediately to conceive; and I could not but admire the
dog for the use he had been ingenious enough to make of our
acquaintance in order to supplant me.&nbsp; All is fair in love
and war.&nbsp; For all that, I was now no less anxious to do the
speaking myself than I had been before to hear Flora.&nbsp; At
least, I could keep clear of the hateful image of Major
Chevenix.&nbsp; Accordingly I burst at once on the narrative of
my adventures.&nbsp; It was the same as you have read, but
briefer, and told with a very different purpose.&nbsp; Now every
incident had a particular bearing, every by-way branched off to
Rome&mdash;and that was Flora.</p>
<p>When I had begun to speak I had kneeled upon the gravel
withoutside the low window, rested my arms upon the sill, and
lowered my voice to the most confidential whisper.&nbsp; Flora
herself must kneel upon the other side, and this brought our
heads upon a level with only the bars between us.&nbsp; So
placed, so separated, it seemed that our proximity, and the
continuous and low sounds of my pleading voice, worked
progressively and powerfully on her heart, and perhaps not less
so on my own.&nbsp; For these spells are double-edged.&nbsp; The
silly birds may be charmed with the pipe of the fowler, which is
but a tube of reeds.&nbsp; Not so with a bird of our own
feather!&nbsp; As I went on, and my resolve strengthened, and my
voice found new modulations, and our faces were drawn closer to
the bars and to each other, not only she, but I, succumbed to the
fascination, and were kindled by the charm.&nbsp; We make love,
and thereby ourselves fall the deeper in it.&nbsp; It is with the
heart only that one captures a heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;I will tell you
what you can still do for me.&nbsp; I run a little risk just now,
and you see for yourself how unavoidable it is for any man of
honour.&nbsp; But if&mdash;but in case of the worst I do not
choose to enrich either my enemies or the Prince Regent.&nbsp; I
have here the bulk of what my uncle gave me.&nbsp; Eight thousand
odd pounds.&nbsp; Will you take care of it for me?&nbsp; Do not
think of it merely as money; take and keep it as a relic of your
friend or some precious piece of him.&nbsp; I may have bitter
need of it ere long.&nbsp; Do you know the old country story of
the giant who gave his heart to his wife to keep for him,
thinking it safer to repose on her loyalty than his own
strength?&nbsp; Flora, I am the giant&mdash;a very little one:
will you be the keeper of my life?&nbsp; It is my heart I offer
you in this symbol.&nbsp; In the sight of God, if you will have
it, I give you my name, I endow you with my money.&nbsp; If the
worst come, if I may never hope to call you wife, let me at least
think that you will use my uncle&rsquo;s legacy as my
widow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not that,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What then?&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What else, my
angel?&nbsp; What are words to me?&nbsp; There is but one name
that I care to know you by.&nbsp; Flora, my love!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>What sound is so full of music as one&rsquo;s own name uttered
for the first time in the voice of her we love!</p>
<p>&lsquo;My darling!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>The jealous bars, set at the top and bottom in stone and lime,
obstructed the rapture of the moment; but I took her to myself as
wholly as they allowed.&nbsp; She did not shun my lips.&nbsp; My
arms were wound round her body, which yielded itself generously
to my embrace.&nbsp; As we so remained, entwined and yet severed,
bruising our faces unconsciously on the cold bars, the irony of
the universe&mdash;or as I prefer to say, envy of some of the
gods&mdash;again stirred up the elements of that stormy
night.&nbsp; The wind blew again in the tree-tops; a volley of
cold sea-rain deluged the garden, and, as the deuce would have
it, a gutter which had been hitherto choked up began suddenly to
play upon my head and shoulders with the vivacity of a
fountain.&nbsp; We parted with a shock; I sprang to my feet, and
she to hers, as though we had been discovered.&nbsp; A moment
after, but now both standing, we had again approached the window
on either side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Flora,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;this is but a poor offer I
can make you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took my hand in hers and clasped it to her bosom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rich enough for a queen!&rsquo; she said, with a lift
in her breathing that was more eloquent than words.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Anne, my brave Anne!&nbsp; I would be glad to be your
maidservant; I could envy that boy Rowley.&nbsp; But, no!&rsquo;
she broke off, &lsquo;I envy no one&mdash;I need not&mdash;I am
yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mine,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for ever!&nbsp; By this and
this, mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All of me,&rsquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Altogether
and forever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And if the god were envious, he must have seen with
mortification how little he could do to mar the happiness of
mortals.&nbsp; I stood in a mere waterspout; she herself was wet,
not from my embrace only, but from the splashing of the
storm.&nbsp; The candles had guttered out; we were in
darkness.&nbsp; I could scarce see anything but the shining of
her eyes in the dark room.&nbsp; To her I must have appeared as a
silhouette, haloed by rain and the spouting of the ancient Gothic
gutter above my head.</p>
<p>Presently we became more calm and confidential; and when that
squall, which proved to be the last of the storm, had blown by,
fell into a talk of ways and means.&nbsp; It seemed she knew Mr.
Robbie, to whom I had been so slenderly accredited by
Romaine&mdash;was even invited to his house for the evening of
Monday, and gave me a sketch of the old gentleman&rsquo;s
character which implied a great deal of penetration in herself,
and proved of great use to me in the immediate sequel.&nbsp; It
seemed he was an enthusiastic antiquary, and in particular a
fanatic of heraldry.&nbsp; I heard it with delight, for I was
myself, thanks to M. de Culemberg, fairly grounded in that
science, and acquainted with the blazons of most families of note
in Europe.&nbsp; And I had made up my mind&mdash;even as she
spoke, it was my fixed determination, though I was a hundred
miles from saying it&mdash;to meet Flora on Monday night as a
fellow-guest in Mr. Robbie&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>I gave her my money&mdash;it was, of course, only paper I had
brought.&nbsp; I gave it her, to be her marriage-portion, I
declared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so bad a marriage-portion for a private
soldier,&rsquo; I told her, laughing, as I passed it through the
bars.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Anne, and where am I to keep it?&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;If my aunt should find it!&nbsp; What would I
say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next your heart,&rsquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you will always be near your treasure,&rsquo; she
cried, &lsquo;for you are always there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We were interrupted by a sudden clearness that fell upon the
night.&nbsp; The clouds dispersed; the stars shone in every part
of the heavens; and, consulting my watch, I was startled to find
it already hard on five in the morning.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;THE SABBATH DAY</h2>
<p>It was indeed high time I should be gone from Swanston; but
what I was to do in the meanwhile was another question.&nbsp;
Rowley had received his orders last night: he was to say that I
had met a friend, and Mrs. McRankine was not to expect me before
morning.&nbsp; A good enough tale in itself; but the dreadful
pickle I was in made it out of the question.&nbsp; I could not go
home till I had found harbourage, a fire to dry my clothes at,
and a bed where I might lie till they were ready.</p>
<p>Fortune favoured me again.&nbsp; I had scarce got to the top
of the first hill when I spied a light on my left, about a
furlong away.&nbsp; It might be a case of sickness; what else it
was likely to be&mdash;in so rustic a neighbourhood, and at such
an ungodly time of the morning&mdash;was beyond my fancy.&nbsp; A
faint sound of singing became audible, and gradually swelled as I
drew near, until at last I could make out the words, which were
singularly appropriate both to the hour and to the condition of
the singers.&nbsp; &lsquo;The cock may craw, the day may
daw,&rsquo; they sang; and sang it with such laxity both in time
and tune, and such sentimental complaisance in the expression, as
assured me they had got far into the third bottle at least.</p>
<p>I found a plain rustic cottage by the wayside, of the sort
called double, with a signboard over the door; and, the lights
within streaming forth and somewhat mitigating the darkness of
the morning, I was enabled to decipher the inscription:
&lsquo;The Hunters&rsquo; Tryst, by Alexander Hendry.&nbsp;
Porter Ales, and British Spirits.&nbsp; Beds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My first knock put a period to the music, and a voice
challenged tipsily from within.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo; it said; and I replied, &lsquo;A
lawful traveller.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immediately after, the door was unbarred by a company of the
tallest lads my eyes had ever rested on, all astonishingly drunk
and very decently dressed, and one (who was perhaps the drunkest
of the lot) carrying a tallow candle, from which he impartially
bedewed the clothes of the whole company.&nbsp; As soon as I saw
them I could not help smiling to myself to remember the anxiety
with which I had approached.&nbsp; They received me and my
hastily-concocted story, that I had been walking from Peebles and
had lost my way, with incoherent benignity; jostled me among them
into the room where they had been sitting, a plain hedgerow
alehouse parlour, with a roaring fire in the chimney and a
prodigious number of empty bottles on the floor; and informed me
that I was made, by this reception, a temporary member of the
<i>Six-Feet-High Club</i>, an athletic society of young men in a
good station, who made of the Hunters&rsquo; Tryst a frequent
resort.&nbsp; They told me I had intruded on an &lsquo;all-night
sitting,&rsquo; following upon an &lsquo;all-day Saturday
tramp&rsquo; of forty miles; and that the members would all be up
and &lsquo;as right as ninepence&rsquo; for the noonday service
at some neighbouring church&mdash;Collingwood, if memory serves
me right.&nbsp; At this I could have laughed, but the moment
seemed ill-chosen.&nbsp; For, though six feet was their standard,
they all exceeded that measurement considerably; and I tasted
again some of the sensations of childhood, as I looked up to all
these lads from a lower plane, and wondered what they would do
next.&nbsp; But the Six-Footers, if they were very drunk, proved
no less kind.&nbsp; The landlord and servants of the
Hunters&rsquo; Tryst were in bed and asleep long ago.&nbsp;
Whether by natural gift or acquired habit they could suffer
pandemonium to reign all over the house, and yet lie ranked in
the kitchen like Egyptian mummies, only that the sound of their
snoring rose and fell ceaselessly like the drone of a
bagpipe.&nbsp; Here the Six-Footers invaded them&mdash;in their
citadel, so to speak; counted the bunks and the sleepers;
proposed to put me in bed to one of the lasses, proposed to have
one of the lasses out to make room for me, fell over chairs, and
made noise enough to waken the dead: the whole illuminated by the
same young torch-bearer, but now with two candles, and rapidly
beginning to look like a man in a snowstorm.&nbsp; At last a bed
was found for me, my clothes were hung out to dry before the
parlour fire, and I was mercifully left to my repose.</p>
<p>I awoke about nine with the sun shining in my eyes.&nbsp; The
landlord came at my summons, brought me my clothes dried and
decently brushed, and gave me the good news that the
Six-Feet-High Club were all abed and sleeping off their
excesses.&nbsp; Where they were bestowed was a puzzle to me until
(as I was strolling about the garden patch waiting for breakfast)
I came on a barn door, and, looking in, saw all the red face
mixed in the straw like plums in a cake.&nbsp; Quoth the stalwart
maid who brought me my porridge and bade me &rsquo;eat them while
they were hot,&rsquo; &lsquo;Ay, they were a&rsquo; on the
ran-dan last nicht!&nbsp; Hout! they&rsquo;re fine lads, and
they&rsquo;ll be nane the waur of it.&nbsp; Forby Farbes&rsquo;s
coat.&nbsp; I dinna see wha&rsquo;s to get the creish off
that!&rsquo; she added, with a sigh; in which, identifying Forbes
as the torch-bearer, I mentally joined.</p>
<p>It was a brave morning when I took the road; the sun shone,
spring seemed in the air, it smelt like April or May, and some
over-venturous birds sang in the coppices as I went by.&nbsp; I
had plenty to think of, plenty to be grateful for, that gallant
morning; and yet I had a twitter at my heart.&nbsp; To enter the
city by daylight might be compared to marching on a battery;
every face that I confronted would threaten me like the muzzle of
a gun; and it came into my head suddenly with how much better a
countenance I should be able to do it if I could but improvise a
companion.&nbsp; Hard by Merchiston I was so fortunate as to
observe a bulky gentleman in broadcloth and gaiters, stooping
with his head almost between his knees, before a stone
wall.&nbsp; Seizing occasion by the forelock, I drew up as I came
alongside and inquired what he had found to interest him.</p>
<p>He turned upon me a countenance not much less broad than his
back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;I was even
marvelling at my own indefeasible stupeedity: that I should walk
this way every week of my life, weather permitting, and should
never before have <i>notticed</i> that stone,&rsquo; touching it
at the same time with a goodly oak staff.</p>
<p>I followed the indication.&nbsp; The stone, which had been
built sideways into the wall, offered traces of heraldic
sculpture.&nbsp; At once there came a wild idea into my mind: his
appearance tallied with Flora&rsquo;s description of Mr. Robbie;
a knowledge of heraldry would go far to clinch the proof; and
what could be more desirable than to scrape an informal
acquaintance with the man whom I must approach next day with my
tale of the drovers, and whom I yet wished to please?&nbsp; I
stooped in turn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A chevron,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;on a chief three
mullets?&nbsp; Looks like Douglas, does it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, it does; you are right,&rsquo; said he:
&lsquo;it <i>does</i> look like Douglas; though, without the
tinctures, and the whole thing being so battered and broken up,
who shall venture an opinion?&nbsp; But allow me to be more
personal, sir.&nbsp; In these degenerate days I am astonished you
should display so much proficiency.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I was well grounded in my youth by an old gentleman,
a friend of my family, and I may say my guardian,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;but I have forgotten it since.&nbsp; God forbid I should
delude you into thinking me a herald, sir!&nbsp; I am only an
ungrammatical amateur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a little modesty does no harm even in a
herald,&rsquo; says my new acquaintance graciously.</p>
<p>In short, we fell together on our onward way, and maintained
very amicable discourse along what remained of the country road,
past the suburbs, and on into the streets of the New Town, which
was as deserted and silent as a city of the dead.&nbsp; The shops
were closed, no vehicle ran, cats sported in the midst of the
sunny causeway; and our steps and voices re-echoed from the quiet
houses.&nbsp; It was the high-water, full and strange, of that
weekly trance to which the city of Edinburgh is subjected: the
apotheosis of the <i>Sawbath</i>; and I confess the spectacle
wanted not grandeur, however much it may have lacked
cheerfulness.&nbsp; There are few religious ceremonies more
imposing.&nbsp; As we thus walked and talked in a public
seclusion the bells broke out ringing through all the bounds of
the city, and the streets began immediately to be thronged with
decent church-goers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said my companion, &lsquo;there are the
bells!&nbsp; Now, sir, as you are a stranger I must offer you the
hospitality of my pew.&nbsp; I do not know whether you are at all
used with our Scottish form; but in case you are not I will find
your places for you; and Dr. Henry Gray, of St. Mary&rsquo;s
(under whom I sit), is as good a preacher as we have to show
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This put me in a quandary.&nbsp; It was a degree of risk I was
scarce prepared for.&nbsp; Dozens of people, who might pass me by
in the street with no more than a second look, would go on from
the second to the third, and from that to a final recognition, if
I were set before them, immobilised in a pew, during the whole
time of service.&nbsp; An unlucky turn of the head would suffice
to arrest their attention.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; they
would think: &lsquo;surely I should know him!&rsquo; and, a
church being the place in all the world where one has least to
think of, it was ten to one they would end by remembering me
before the benediction.&nbsp; However, my mind was made up: I
thanked my obliging friend, and placed myself at his
disposal.</p>
<p>Our way now led us into the north-east quarter of the town,
among pleasant new faubourgs, to a decent new church of a good
size, where I was soon seated by the side of my good Samaritan,
and looked upon by a whole congregation of menacing faces.&nbsp;
At first the possibility of danger kept me awake; but by the time
I had assured myself there was none to be apprehended, and the
service was not in the least likely to be enlivened by the arrest
of a French spy, I had to resign myself to the task of listening
to Dr. Henry Gray.</p>
<p>As we moved out, after this ordeal was over, my friend was at
once surrounded and claimed by his acquaintances of the
congregation; and I was rejoiced to hear him addressed by the
expected name of Robbie.</p>
<p>So soon as we were clear of the crowd&mdash;&lsquo;Mr.
Robbie?&rsquo; said I, bowing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very same, sir,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I mistake not, a lawyer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A writer to His Majesty&rsquo;s Signet, at your
service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems we were predestined to be
acquaintances!&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have here a
card in my pocket intended for you.&nbsp; It is from my family
lawyer.&nbsp; It was his last word, as I was leaving, to ask to
be remembered kindly, and to trust you would pass over so
informal an introduction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I offered him the card.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay, my old friend Daniel!&rsquo; says he, looking
on the card.&nbsp; &lsquo;And how does my old friend
Daniel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I gave a favourable view of Mr. Romaine&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, this is certainly a whimsical incident,&rsquo; he
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;And since we are thus met
already&mdash;and so much to my advantage!&mdash;the simplest
thing will be to prosecute the acquaintance instantly.&nbsp; Let
me propose a snack between sermons, a bottle of my particular
green seal&mdash;and when nobody is looking we can talk blazons,
Mr. Ducie!&rsquo;&mdash;which was the name I then used and had
already incidentally mentioned, in the vain hope of provoking a
return in kind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir: do I understand you to invite
me to your house?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was the idea I was trying to convey,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have the name of hospitable people up here,
and I would like you to try mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Robbie, I shall hope to try it some day, but not
yet,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope you will not
misunderstand me.&nbsp; My business, which brings me to your
city, is of a peculiar kind.&nbsp; Till you shall have heard it,
and, indeed, till its issue is known, I should feel as if I had
stolen your invitation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said he, a little sobered, &lsquo;it
must be as you wish, though you would hardly speak otherwise if
you had committed homicide!&nbsp; Mine is the loss.&nbsp; I must
eat alone; a very pernicious thing for a person of my habit of
body, content myself with a pint of skinking claret, and meditate
the discourse.&nbsp; But about this business of yours: if it is
so particular as all that, it will doubtless admit of no
delay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must confess, sir, it presses,&rsquo; I
acknowledged.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, let us say to-morrow at half-past eight in the
morning,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;and I hope, when your mind is at
rest (and it does you much honour to take it as you do), that you
will sit down with me to the postponed meal, not forgetting the
bottle.&nbsp; You have my address?&rsquo; he added, and gave it
me&mdash;which was the only thing I wanted.</p>
<p>At last, at the level of York Place, we parted with mutual
civilities, and I was free to pursue my way, through the mobs of
people returning from church, to my lodgings in St. James&rsquo;
Square.</p>
<p>Almost at the house door whom should I overtake but my
landlady in a dress of gorgeous severity, and dragging a prize in
her wake: no less than Rowley, with the cockade in his hat, and a
smart pair of tops to his boots!&nbsp; When I said he was in the
lady&rsquo;s wake I spoke but in metaphor.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact he was squiring her, with the utmost dignity, on his arm;
and I followed them up the stairs, smiling to myself.</p>
<p>Both were quick to salute me as soon as I was perceived, and
Mrs. McRankine inquired where I had been.&nbsp; I told her
boastfully, giving her the name of the church and the divine, and
ignorantly supposing I should have gained caste.&nbsp; But she
soon opened my eyes.&nbsp; In the roots of the Scottish character
there are knots and contortions that not only no stranger can
understand, but no stranger can follow; he walks among
explosives; and his best course is to throw himself upon their
mercy&mdash;&lsquo;Just as I am, without one plea,&rsquo; a
citation from one of the lady&rsquo;s favourite hymns.</p>
<p>The sound she made was unmistakable in meaning, though it was
impossible to be written down; and I at once executed the
manoeuvre I have recommended.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must remember I am a perfect stranger in your
city,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I have done wrong, it was in
mere ignorance, my dear lady; and this afternoon, if you will be
so good as to take me, I shall accompany <i>you</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she was not to be pacified at the moment, and departed to
her own quarters murmuring.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Rowley,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and have you been
to church?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, sir,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you have not been any less unlucky than I
have,&rsquo; I returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;And how did you get on with
the Scottish form?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, it was pretty &rsquo;ard, the form was, and
reether narrow,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
know w&rsquo;y it is, but it seems to me like as if things were a
good bit changed since William Wallace!&nbsp; That was a main
queer church she took me to, Mr. Anne!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
as I could have sat it out, if she &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;a&rsquo; give me peppermints.&nbsp; She ain&rsquo;t a bad
one at bottom, the old girl; she do pounce a bit, and she do
worry, but, law bless you, Mr. Anne, it ain&rsquo;t nothink
really&mdash;she don&rsquo;t <i>mean</i> it.&nbsp; W&rsquo;y, she
was down on me like a &rsquo;undredweight of bricks this
morning.&nbsp; You see, last night she &rsquo;ad me in to supper,
and, I beg your pardon, sir, but I took the freedom of playing
her a chune or two.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t mind a bit; so this
morning I began to play to myself, and she flounced in, and flew
up, and carried on no end about Sunday!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, Rowley,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re
all mad up here, and you have to humour them.&nbsp; See and
don&rsquo;t quarrel with Mrs. McRankine; and, above all,
don&rsquo;t argue with her, or you&rsquo;ll get the worst of
it.&nbsp; Whatever she says, touch your forelock and say,
&ldquo;If you please!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I beg pardon,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp; And let me tell you one thing: I am
sorry, but you have to go to church with her again this
afternoon.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s duty, my boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I had foreseen, the bells had scarce begun before Mrs.
McRankine presented herself to be our escort, upon which I sprang
up with readiness and offered her my arm.&nbsp; Rowley followed
behind.&nbsp; I was beginning to grow accustomed to the risks of
my stay in Edinburgh, and it even amused me to confront a new
churchful.&nbsp; I confess the amusement did not last until the
end; for if Dr. Gray were long, Mr. McCraw was not only longer,
but more incoherent, and the matter of his sermon (which was a
direct attack, apparently, on all the Churches of the world, my
own among the number), where it had not the tonic quality of
personal insult, rather inclined me to slumber.&nbsp; But I
braced myself for my life, kept up Rowley with the end of a pin,
and came through it awake, but no more.</p>
<p>Bethiah was quite conquered by this &lsquo;mark of
grace,&rsquo; though, I am afraid, she was also moved by more
worldly considerations.&nbsp; The first is, the lady had not the
least objection to go to church on the arm of an elegantly
dressed young gentleman, and be followed by a spruce servant with
a cockade in his hat.&nbsp; I could see it by the way she took
possession of us, found us the places in the Bible, whispered to
me the name of the minister, passed us lozenges, which I (for my
part) handed on to Rowley, and at each fresh attention stole a
little glance about the church to make sure she was
observed.&nbsp; Rowley was a pretty boy; you will pardon me if I
also remembered that I was a favourable-looking young man.&nbsp;
When we grow elderly, how the room brightens, and begins to look
as it ought to look, on the entrance of youth, grace, health, and
comeliness!&nbsp; You do not want them for yourself, perhaps not
even for your son, but you look on smiling; and when you recall
their images&mdash;again, it is with a smile.&nbsp; I defy you to
see or think of them and not smile with an infinite and intimate,
but quite impersonal, pleasure.&nbsp; Well, either I know nothing
of women, or that was the case with Bethiah McRankine.&nbsp; She
had been to church with a cockade behind her, on the one hand; on
the other, her house was brightened by the presence of a pair of
good-looking young fellows of the other sex, who were always
pleased and deferential in her society and accepted her views as
final.</p>
<p>These were sentiments to be encouraged; and, on the way home
from church&mdash;if church it could be called&mdash;I adopted a
most insidious device to magnify her interest.&nbsp; I took her
into the confidence, that is, of my love affair, and I had no
sooner mentioned a young lady with whom my affections were
engaged than she turned upon me a face of awful gravity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she bonny?&rsquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>I gave her full assurances upon that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To what denoamination does she beloang?&rsquo; came
next, and was so unexpected as almost to deprive me of
breath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my word, ma&rsquo;am, I have never
inquired,&rsquo; cried I; &lsquo;I only know that she is a
heartfelt Christian, and that is enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay!&rsquo; she sighed, &lsquo;if she has the root of
the maitter!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a remnant practically in most of
the denoaminations.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s some in the
McGlashanites, and some in the Glassites, and mony in the
McMillanites, and there&rsquo;s a leeven even in the
Estayblishment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have known some very good Papists even, if you go to
that,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ducie, think shame to yoursel&rsquo;!&rsquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, my dear madam!&nbsp; I only&mdash;&rsquo; I
began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shouldnae jest in sairious maitters,&rsquo; she
interrupted.</p>
<p>On the whole, she entered into what I chose to tell her of our
idyll with avidity, like a cat licking her whiskers over a dish
of cream; and, strange to say&mdash;and so expansive a passion is
that of love!&mdash;that I derived a perhaps equal satisfaction
from confiding in that breast of iron.&nbsp; It made an immediate
bond: from that hour we seemed to be welded into a family-party;
and I had little difficulty in persuading her to join us and to
preside over our tea-table.&nbsp; Surely there was never so
ill-matched a trio as Rowley, Mrs. McRankine, and the Viscount
Anne!&nbsp; But I am of the Apostle&rsquo;s way, with a
difference: all things to all women!&nbsp; When I cannot please a
woman, hang me in my cravat!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;EVENTS OF MONDAY: THE LAWYER&rsquo;S
PARTY</h2>
<p>By half-past eight o&rsquo;clock on the next morning, I was
ringing the bell of the lawyer&rsquo;s office in Castle Street,
where I found him ensconced at a business table, in a room
surrounded by several tiers of green tin cases.&nbsp; He greeted
me like an old friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come away, sir, come away!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here is the dentist ready for you, and I think I can
promise you that the operation will be practically
painless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not so sure of that, Mr. Robbie,&rsquo; I replied,
as I shook hands with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;But at least there shall
be no time lost with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had to confess to having gone a-roving with a pair of
drovers and their cattle, to having used a false name, to having
murdered or half-murdered a fellow-creature in a scuffle on the
moors, and to having suffered a couple of quite innocent men to
lie some time in prison on a charge from which I could have
immediately freed them.&nbsp; All this I gave him first of all,
to be done with the worst of it; and all this he took with
gravity, but without the least appearance of surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, sir,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;I expect to have
to pay for my unhappy frolic, but I would like very well if it
could be managed without my personal appearance or even the
mention of my real name.&nbsp; I had so much wisdom as to sail
under false colours in this foolish jaunt of mine; my family
would be extremely concerned if they had wind of it; but at the
same time, if the case of this Faa has terminated fatally, and
there are proceedings against Todd and Candlish, I am not going
to stand by and see them vexed, far less punished; and I
authorise you to give me up for trial if you think that
best&mdash;or, if you think it unnecessary, in the meanwhile to
make preparations for their defence.&nbsp; I hope, sir, that I am
as little anxious to be Quixotic, as I am determined to be
just.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very fairly spoken,&rsquo; said Mr. Robbie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is not much in my line, as doubtless your friend, Mr.
Romaine, will have told you.&nbsp; I rarely mix myself up with
anything on the criminal side, or approaching it.&nbsp; However,
for a young gentleman like you, I may stretch a point, and I dare
say I may be able to accomplish more than perhaps another.&nbsp;
I will go at once to the Procurator Fiscal&rsquo;s office and
inquire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait a moment, Mr. Robbie,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You forget the chapter of expenses.&nbsp; I had thought,
for a beginning, of placing a thousand pounds in your
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear sir, you will kindly wait until I render you my
bill,&rsquo; said Mr. Robbie severely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seemed to me,&rsquo; I protested, &lsquo;that coming
to you almost as a stranger, and placing in your hands a piece of
business so contrary to your habits, some substantial guarantee
of my good faith&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not the way that we do business in Scotland,
sir,&rsquo; he interrupted, with an air of closing the
dispute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet, Mr. Robbie,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;I must
ask you to allow me to proceed.&nbsp; I do not merely refer to
the expenses of the case.&nbsp; I have my eye besides on Todd and
Candlish.&nbsp; They are thoroughly deserving fellows; they have
been subjected through me to a considerable term of imprisonment;
and I suggest, sir, that you should not spare money for their
indemnification.&nbsp; This will explain,&rsquo; I added smiling,
&lsquo;my offer of the thousand pounds.&nbsp; It was in the
nature of a measure by which you should judge the scale on which
I can afford to have this business carried through.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I take you perfectly, Mr. Ducie,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But the sooner I am off, the better this affair is like to
be guided.&nbsp; My clerk will show you into the waiting-room and
give you the day&rsquo;s <i>Caledonian Mercury</i> and the last
<i>Register</i> to amuse yourself with in the
interval.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I believe Mr. Robbie was at least three hours gone.&nbsp; I
saw him descend from a cab at the door, and almost immediately
after I was shown again into his study, where the solemnity of
his manner led me to augur the worst.&nbsp; For some time he had
the inhumanity to read me a lecture as to the incredible
silliness, &lsquo;not to say immorality,&rsquo; of my
behaviour.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have the satisfaction in telling you my
opinion, because it appears that you are going to get off scot
free,&rsquo; he continued, where, indeed, I thought he might have
begun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man, Faa, has been discharged cured; and the two
men, Todd and Candlish, would have been leeberated lone ago if it
had not been for their extraordinary loyalty to yourself, Mr.
Ducie&mdash;or Mr. St. Ivey, as I believe I should now call
you.&nbsp; Never a word would either of the two old fools
volunteer that in any manner pointed at the existence of such a
person; and when they were confronted with Faa&rsquo;s version of
the affair, they gave accounts so entirely discrepant with their
own former declarations, as well as with each other, that the
Fiscal was quite nonplussed, and imaigined there was something
behind it.&nbsp; You may believe I soon laughed him out of
that!&nbsp; And I had the satisfaction of seeing your two friends
set free, and very glad to be on the causeway again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, sir,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;you should have brought
them here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No instructions, Mr. Ducie!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How did I know you wished to renew an acquaintance which
you had just terminated so fortunately?&nbsp; And, indeed, to be
frank with you, I should have set my face against it, if you
had!&nbsp; Let them go!&nbsp; They are paid and contented, and
have the highest possible opinion of Mr. St. Ivey!&nbsp; When I
gave them fifty pounds apiece&mdash;which was rather more than
enough, Mr. Ducie, whatever you may think&mdash;the man Todd, who
has the only tongue of the party, struck his staff on the
ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I aye said he
was a gentleman!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Man, Todd,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;that was just what Mr St. Ivey said of
yourself!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it was a case of &ldquo;Compliments fly when
gentlefolk meet.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Mr. Ducie, man Todd and man Candlish are gone
out of your life, and a good riddance!&nbsp; They are fine
fellows in their way, but no proper associates for the like of
yourself; and do you finally agree to be done with all
eccentricity&mdash;take up with no more drovers, or tinkers, but
enjoy the naitural pleesures for which your age, your wealth,
your intelligence, and (if I may be allowed to say it) your
appearance so completely fit you.&nbsp; And the first of
these,&rsquo; quoth he, looking at his watch, &lsquo;will be to
step through to my dining-room and share a bachelor&rsquo;s
luncheon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Over the meal, which was good, Mr. Robbie continued to develop
the same theme.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re, no doubt, what they
call a dancing-man?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, on
Thursday night there is the Assembly Ball.&nbsp; You must
certainly go there, and you must permit me besides to do the
honours of the ceety and send you a ticket.&nbsp; I am a thorough
believer in a young man being a young man&mdash;but no more
drovers or rovers, if you love me!&nbsp; Talking of which puts me
in mind that you may be short of partners at the
Assembly&mdash;oh, I have been young myself!&mdash;and if ye care
to come to anything so portentiously tedious as a tea-party at
the house of a bachelor lawyer, consisting mainly of his nieces
and nephews, and his grand-nieces and grand-nephews, and his
wards, and generally the whole clan of the descendants of his
clients, you might drop in to-night towards seven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I think I can show you one or two that are
worth looking at, and you can dance with them later on at the
Assembly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He proceeded to give me a sketch of one or two eligible young
ladies&rsquo; whom I might expect to meet.&nbsp; &lsquo;And then
there&rsquo;s my parteecular friend, Miss Flora,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll make no attempt of a
description.&nbsp; You shall see her for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It will be readily supposed that I accepted his invitation;
and returned home to make a toilette worthy of her I was to meet
and the good news of which I was the bearer.&nbsp; The toilette,
I have reason to believe, was a success.&nbsp; Mr. Rowley
dismissed me with a farewell: &lsquo;Crikey!&nbsp; Mr. Anne, but
you do look prime!&rsquo;&nbsp; Even the stony Bethiah
was&mdash;how shall I say?&mdash;dazzled, but scandalised, by my
appearance; and while, of course, she deplored the vanity that
led to it, she could not wholly prevent herself from admiring the
result.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, Mr. Ducie, this is a poor employment for a
wayfaring Christian man!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wi&rsquo;
Christ despised and rejectit in all pairts of the world and the
flag of the Covenant flung doon, you will be muckle better on
your knees!&nbsp; However, I&rsquo;ll have to confess that it
sets you weel.&nbsp; And if it&rsquo;s the lassie ye&rsquo;re
gaun to see the nicht, I suppose I&rsquo;ll just have to excuse
ye!&nbsp; Bairns maun be bairns!&rsquo; she said, with a
sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I mind when Mr. McRankine came courtin&rsquo;,
and that&rsquo;s lang by-gane&mdash;I mind I had a green gown,
passementit, that was thocht to become me to admiration.&nbsp; I
was nae just exactly what ye would ca&rsquo; bonny; but I was
pale, penetratin&rsquo;, and interestin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
she leaned over the stair-rail with a candle to watch my descent
as long as it should be possible.</p>
<p>It was but a little party at Mr. Robbie&rsquo;s&mdash;by
which, I do not so much mean that there were few people, for the
rooms were crowded, as that there was very little attempted to
entertain them.&nbsp; In one apartment there were tables set out,
where the elders were solemnly engaged upon whist; in the other
and larger one, a great number of youth of both sexes entertained
themselves languidly, the ladies sitting upon chairs to be
courted, the gentlemen standing about in various attitudes of
insinuation or indifference.&nbsp; Conversation appeared the sole
resource, except in so far as it was modified by a number of
keepsakes and annuals which lay dispersed upon the tables, and of
which the young beaux displayed the illustrations to the
ladies.&nbsp; Mr. Robbie himself was customarily in the
card-room; only now and again, when he cut out, he made an
incursion among the young folks, and rolled about jovially from
one to another, the very picture of the general uncle.</p>
<p>It chanced that Flora had met Mr. Robbie in the course of the
afternoon.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Miss Flora,&rsquo; he had said,
&lsquo;come early, for I have a Phoenix to show you&mdash;one Mr.
Ducie, a new client of mine that, I vow, I have fallen in love
with&rsquo;; and he was so good as to add a word or two on my
appearance, from which Flora conceived a suspicion of the
truth.&nbsp; She had come to the party, in consequence, on the
knife-edge of anticipation and alarm; had chosen a place by the
door, where I found her, on my arrival, surrounded by a posse of
vapid youths; and, when I drew near, sprang up to meet me in the
most natural manner in the world, and, obviously, with a prepared
form of words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you do, Mr. Ducie?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is quite an age since I have seen you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have much to tell you, Miss Gilchrist,&rsquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;May I sit down?&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the artful girl, by sitting near the door, and the
judicious use of her shawl, had contrived to keep a chair empty
by her side.</p>
<p>She made room for me, as a matter of course, and the youths
had the discretion to melt before us.&nbsp; As soon as I was once
seated her fan flew out, and she whispered behind it:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you mad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madly in love,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;but in no other
sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no patience!&nbsp; You cannot understand what I
am suffering!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you to say
to Ronald, to Major Chevenix, to my aunt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Your aunt?&rsquo; I cried, with a start.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Peccavi</i>! is she here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is in the card-room at whist,&rsquo; said
Flora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where she will probably stay all the evening?&rsquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She may,&rsquo; she admitted; &lsquo;she generally
does!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I must avoid the card-room,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;which is very much what I had counted upon doing.&nbsp; I
did not come here to play cards, but to contemplate a certain
young lady to my heart&rsquo;s content&mdash;if it can ever be
contented!&mdash;and to tell her some good news.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there are still Ronald and the Major!&rsquo; she
persisted.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are not card-room fixtures!&nbsp;
Ronald will be coming and going.&nbsp; And as for Mr. Chevenix,
he&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always sits with Miss Flora?&rsquo; I
interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;And they talk of poor St. Ives?&nbsp; I
had gathered as much, my dear; and Mr. Ducie has come to prevent
it!&nbsp; But pray dismiss these fears!&nbsp; I mind no one but
your aunt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why my aunt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because your aunt is a lady, my dear, and a very clever
lady, and, like all clever ladies, a very rash lady,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can never count upon them, unless you are
sure of getting them in a corner, as I have got you, and talking
them over rationally, as I am just engaged on with
yourself!&nbsp; It would be quite the same to your aunt to make
the worst kind of a scandal, with an equal indifference to my
danger and to the feelings of our good host!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and what of Ronald,
then?&nbsp; Do you think <i>he</i> is above making a
scandal?&nbsp; You must know him very little!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the other hand, it is my pretension that I know him
very well!&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must speak to Ronald
first&mdash;not Ronald to me&mdash;that is all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, please, go and speak to him at once!&rsquo; she
pleaded.&nbsp; He is there&mdash;do you see?&mdash;at the upper
end of the room, talking to that girl in pink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so lose this seat before I have told you my good
news?&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Catch me!&nbsp; And,
besides, my dear one, think a little of me and my good
news!&nbsp; I thought the bearer of good news was always
welcome!&nbsp; I hoped he might be a little welcome for
himself!&nbsp; Consider!&nbsp; I have but one friend; and let me
stay by her!&nbsp; And there is only one thing I care to hear;
and let me hear it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Anne,&rsquo; she sighed, &lsquo;if I did not love
you, why should I be so uneasy?&nbsp; I am turned into a coward,
dear!&nbsp; Think, if it were the other way round&mdash;if you
were quite safe and I was in, oh, such danger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had no sooner said it than I was convicted of being a
dullard.&nbsp; &lsquo;God forgive me, dear!&rsquo;&nbsp; I made
haste to reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never saw before that there were
two sides to this!&rsquo;&nbsp; And I told her my tale as briefly
as I could, and rose to seek Ronald.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see, my
dear, you are obeyed,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>She gave me a look that was a reward in itself; and as I
turned away from her, with a strong sense of turning away from
the sun, I carried that look in my bosom like a caress.&nbsp; The
girl in pink was an arch, ogling person, with a good deal of eyes
and teeth, and a great play of shoulders and rattle of
conversation.&nbsp; There could be no doubt, from Mr.
Ronald&rsquo;s attitude, that he worshipped the very chair she
sat on.&nbsp; But I was quite ruthless.&nbsp; I laid my hand on
his shoulder, as he was stooping over her like a hen over a
chicken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me for one moment, Mr. Gilchrist!&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>He started and span about in answer to my touch, and exhibited
a face of inarticulate wonder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;it is even
myself!&nbsp; Pardon me for interrupting so agreeable a
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, but you know, my good
fellow, we owe a first duty to Mr. Robbie.&nbsp; It would never
do to risk making a scene in the man&rsquo;s drawing-room; so the
first thing I had to attend to was to have you warned.&nbsp; The
name I go by is Ducie, too, in case of accidents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I say, you know!&rsquo; cried Ronald.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Deuce take it, what are you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not the place,
my dear fellow&mdash;not the place.&nbsp; Come to my rooms, if
you like, to-night after the party, or to-morrow in the morning,
and we can talk it out over a segar.&nbsp; But here, you know, it
really won&rsquo;t do at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before he could collect his mind for an answer, I had given
him my address in St. James Square, and had again mingled with
the crowd.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I was not fated to get back to Flora
so easily!&nbsp; Mr. Robbie was in the path: he was insatiably
loquacious; and as he continued to palaver I watched the insipid
youths gather again about my idol, and cursed my fate and my
host.&nbsp; He remembered suddenly that I was to attend the
Assembly Ball on Thursday, and had only attended to-night by way
of a preparative.&nbsp; This put it into his head to present me
to another young lady; but I managed this interview with so much
art that, while I was scrupulously polite and even cordial to the
fair one, I contrived to keep Robbie beside me all the time and
to leave along with him when the ordeal was over.&nbsp; We were
just walking away arm in arm, when I spied my friend the Major
approaching, stiff as a ramrod and, as usual, obtrusively
clean.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! there&rsquo;s a man I want to know,&rsquo; said I,
taking the bull by the horns.&nbsp; &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you
introduce me to Major Chevenix?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At a word, my dear fellow,&rsquo; said Robbie; and
&lsquo;Major!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;come here and let me
present to you my friend Mr. Ducie, who desires the honour of
your acquaintance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Major flushed visibly, but otherwise preserved his
composure.&nbsp; He bowed very low.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not
very sure,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;I have an idea we have met
before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Informally,&rsquo; I said, returning his bow;
&lsquo;and I have long looked forward to the pleasure of
regularising our acquaintance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very good, Mr. Ducie,&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Perhaps you could aid my memory a little?&nbsp; Where was
it that I had the pleasure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that would be telling tales out of school,&rsquo;
said I, with a laugh, &lsquo;and before my lawyer,
too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wager,&rsquo; broke in Mr. Robbie,
&lsquo;that, when you knew my client, Chevenix&mdash;the past of
our friend Mr. Ducie is an obscure chapter full of horrid
secrets&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wager, now, you knew him as St.
Ivey,&rsquo; says he, nudging me violently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think not, sir,&rsquo; said the Major, with pinched
lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I wish he may prove all right!&rsquo; continued
the lawyer, with certainly the worst-inspired jocularity in the
world.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know nothing by him!&nbsp; He may be a
swell mobsman for me with his aliases.&nbsp; You must put your
memory on the rack, Major, and when ye&rsquo;ve remembered when
and where ye met him, be sure ye tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not fail, sir,&rsquo; said Chevenix.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seek to him!&rsquo; cried Robbie, waving his hand as he
departed.</p>
<p>The Major, as soon as we were alone, turned upon me his
impassive countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you have
courage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is undoubted as your honour, sir,&rsquo; I returned,
bowing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you expect to meet me, may I ask?&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You saw, at least, that I courted the
presentation,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you were not afraid?&rsquo; said Chevenix.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was perfectly at ease.&nbsp; I knew I was dealing
with a gentleman.&nbsp; Be that your epitaph.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there are some other people looking for
you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;who will make no bones about the
point of honour.&nbsp; The police, my dear sir, are simply agog
about you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I think that that was coarse,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have seen Miss Gilchrist?&rsquo; he inquired,
changing the subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With whom, I am led to understand, we are on a footing
of rivalry?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I have seen
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I was just seeking her,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>I was conscious of a certain thrill of temper; so, I suppose,
was he.&nbsp; We looked each other up and down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The situation is original,&rsquo; he resumed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But let me tell you
frankly you are blowing a cold coal.&nbsp; I owe you so much for
your kindness to the prisoner Champdivers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meaning that the lady&rsquo;s affections are more
advantageously disposed of?&rsquo; he asked, with a sneer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank you, I am sure.&nbsp; And, since you have given me a
lead, just hear a word of good advice in your turn.&nbsp; Is it
fair, is it delicate, is it like a gentleman, to compromise the
young lady by attentions which (as you know very well) can come
to nothing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was utterly unable to find words in answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me if I cut this interview short,&rsquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &lsquo;It seems to me doomed to come to nothing, and
there is more attractive metal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;as you say, it cannot
amount to much.&nbsp; You are impotent, bound hand and foot in
honour.&nbsp; You know me to be a man falsely accused, and even
if you did not know it, from your position as my rival you have
only the choice to stand quite still or to be
infamous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not say that,&rsquo; he returned, with another
change of colour.&nbsp; &lsquo;I may hear it once too
often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With which he moved off straight for where Flora was sitting
amidst her court of vapid youths, and I had no choice but to
follow him, a bad second, and reading myself, as I went, a sharp
lesson on the command of temper.</p>
<p>It is a strange thing how young men in their teens go down at
the mere wind of the coming of men of twenty-five and
upwards!&nbsp; The vapid ones fled without thought of resistance
before the Major and me; a few dallied awhile in the
neighbourhood&mdash;so to speak, with their fingers in their
mouths&mdash;but presently these also followed the rout, and we
remained face to face before Flora.&nbsp; There was a draught in
that corner by the door; she had thrown her pelisse over her bare
arms and neck, and the dark fur of the trimming set them
off.&nbsp; She shone by contrast; the light played on her smooth
skin to admiration, and the colour changed in her excited
face.&nbsp; For the least fraction of a second she looked from
one to the other of her pair of rival swains, and seemed to
hesitate.&nbsp; Then she addressed Chevenix:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are coming to the Assembly, of course, Major
Chevenix?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear not; I fear I shall be otherwise engaged,&rsquo;
he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Even the pleasure of dancing with you,
Miss Flora, must give way to duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For awhile the talk ran harmlessly on the weather, and then
branched off towards the war.&nbsp; It seemed to be by no
one&rsquo;s fault; it was in the air, and had to come.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good news from the scene of operations,&rsquo; said the
Major.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good news while it lasts,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But will Miss Gilchrist tell us her private thought upon
the war?&nbsp; In her admiration for the victors, does not there
mingle some pity for the vanquished?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, sir,&rsquo; she said, with animation,
&lsquo;only too much of it!&nbsp; War is a subject that I do not
think should be talked of to a girl.&nbsp; I am, I have to
be&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;a non-combatant?&nbsp; And to
remind me of what others have to do and suffer: no, it is not
fair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Gilchrist has the tender female heart,&rsquo; said
Chevenix.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not be too sure of that!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I would love to be allowed to fight myself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On which side?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you ask?&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a
Scottish girl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is a Scottish girl!&rsquo; repeated the Major,
looking at me.&nbsp; &lsquo;And no one grudges you her
pity!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I glory in every grain of it she has to
spare,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pity is akin to
love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and let us put that question to Miss
Gilchrist.&nbsp; It is for her to decide, and for us to bow to
the decision.&nbsp; Is pity, Miss Flora, or is admiration,
nearest love?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh come,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;let us be more
concrete.&nbsp; Lay before the lady a complete case: describe
your man, then I&rsquo;ll describe <i>mine</i>, and Miss Flora
shall decide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I see your meaning,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and
I&rsquo;ll try.&nbsp; You think that pity&mdash;and the kindred
sentiments&mdash;have the greatest power upon the heart.&nbsp; I
think more nobly of women.&nbsp; To my view, the man they love
will first of all command their respect; he will be
steadfast&mdash;proud, if you please; dry, possibly&mdash;but of
all things steadfast.&nbsp; They will look at him in doubt; at
last they will see that stern face which he presents to all the
rest of the world soften to them alone.&nbsp; First, trust, I
say.&nbsp; It is so that a woman loves who is worthy of
heroes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your man is very ambitious, sir,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and very much of a hero!&nbsp; Mine is a humbler, and, I
would fain think, a more human dog.&nbsp; He is one with no
particular trust in himself, with no superior steadfastness to be
admired for, who sees a lady&rsquo;s face, who hears her voice,
and, without any phrase about the matter, falls in love.&nbsp;
What does he ask for, then, but pity?&mdash;pity for his
weakness, pity for his love, which is his life.&nbsp; You would
make women always the inferiors, gaping up at your imaginary
lover; he, like a marble statue, with his nose in the air!&nbsp;
But God has been wiser than you; and the most steadfast of your
heroes may prove human, after all.&nbsp; We appeal to the queen
for judgment,&rsquo; I added, turning and bowing before
Flora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how shall the queen judge?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I must give you an answer that is no answer at all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The wind bloweth where it listeth&rdquo;: she goes where
her heart goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her face flushed as she said it; mine also, for I read in it a
declaration, and my heart swelled for joy.&nbsp; But Chevenix
grew pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You make of life a very dreadful kind of lottery,
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I will not
despair.&nbsp; Honest and unornamental is still my
choice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I must say he looked extremely handsome and very amusingly
like the marble statue with its nose in the air to which I had
compared him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot imagine how we got upon this subject,&rsquo;
said Flora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madame, it was through the war,&rsquo; replied
Chevenix.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All roads lead to Rome,&rsquo; I commented.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What else would you expect Mr. Chevenix and myself to talk
of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>About this time I was conscious of a certain bustle and
movement in the room behind me, but did not pay to it that degree
of attention which perhaps would have been wise.&nbsp; There came
a certain change in Flora&rsquo;s face; she signalled repeatedly
with her fan; her eyes appealed to me obsequiously; there could
be no doubt that she wanted something&mdash;as well as I could
make out, that I should go away and leave the field clear for my
rival, which I had not the least idea of doing.&nbsp; At last she
rose from her chair with impatience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it time you were saying good-night, Mr
Ducie!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>I could not in the least see why, and said so.</p>
<p>Whereupon she gave me this appalling answer, &lsquo;My aunt is
coming out of the card-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In less time than it takes to tell, I had made my bow and my
escape.&nbsp; Looking back from the doorway, I was privileged to
see, for a moment, the august profile and gold eyeglasses of Miss
Gilchrist issuing from the card-room; and the sight lent me
wings.&nbsp; I stood not on the order of my going; and a moment
after, I was on the pavement of Castle Street, and the lighted
windows shone down on me, and were crossed by ironical shadows of
those who had remained behind.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;EVENTS OF TUESDAY: THE TOILS CLOSING</h2>
<p>This day began with a surprise.&nbsp; I found a letter on my
breakfast-table addressed to Edward Ducie, Esquire; and at first
I was startled beyond measure.&nbsp; &lsquo;Conscience doth make
cowards of us all!&rsquo;&nbsp; When I had opened it, it proved
to be only a note from the lawyer, enclosing a card for the
Assembly Ball on Thursday evening.&nbsp; Shortly after, as I was
composing my mind with a segar at one of the windows of the
sitting-room, and Rowley, having finished the light share of work
that fell to him, sat not far off tootling with great spirit and
a marked preference for the upper octave, Ronald was suddenly
shown in.&nbsp; I got him a segar, drew in a chair to the side of
the fire, and installed him there&mdash;I was going to say, at
his ease, but no expression could be farther from the
truth.&nbsp; He was plainly on pins and needles, did not know
whether to take or to refuse the segar, and, after he had taken
it, did not know whether to light or to return it.&nbsp; I saw he
had something to say; I did not think it was his own something;
and I was ready to offer a large bet it was really something of
Major Chevenix&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and so here you are!&rsquo; I observed, with
pointless cordiality, for I was bound I should do nothing to help
him out.&nbsp; If he were, indeed, here running errands for my
rival, he might have a fair field, but certainly no favour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;I would rather see
you alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, certainly,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rowley,
you can step into the bedroom.&nbsp; My dear fellow,&rsquo; I
continued, &lsquo;this sounds serious.&nbsp; Nothing wrong, I
trust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be quite honest,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I <i>am</i> a good deal bothered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I bet I know why!&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And I bet I can put you to rights, too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean!&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must be hard up,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and all I
can say is, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.&nbsp; If you
have the least use for a hundred pounds, or any such trifling sum
as that, please mention it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s here, quite at your
service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure it is most kind of you,&rsquo; said Ronald,
&lsquo;and the truth is, though I can&rsquo;t think how you
guessed it, that I really <i>am</i> a little behind board.&nbsp;
But I haven&rsquo;t come to talk about that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I dare say!&rsquo; cried I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not worth
talking about!&nbsp; But remember, Ronald, you and I are on
different sides of the business.&nbsp; Remember that you did me
one of those services that make men friends for ever.&nbsp; And
since I have had the fortune to come into a fair share of money,
just oblige me, and consider so much of it as your
own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take it; I
couldn&rsquo;t, really.&nbsp; Besides, the fact is, I&rsquo;ve
come on a very different matter.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about my
sister, St. Ives,&rsquo; and he shook his head menacingly at
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite sure?&rsquo; I persisted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s here, at your service&mdash;up to five hundred
pounds, if you like.&nbsp; Well, all right; only remember where
it is, when you do want it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, please let me alone!&rsquo; cried Ronald:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come to say something unpleasant; and how on
earth can I do it, if you don&rsquo;t give a fellow a
chance?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about my sister, as I said.&nbsp; You
can see for yourself that it can&rsquo;t be allowed to go
on.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s compromising; it don&rsquo;t lead to
anything; and you&rsquo;re not the kind of man (you must feel it
yourself) that I can allow my female relatives to have anything
to do with.&nbsp; I hate saying this, St. Ives; it looks like
hitting a man when he&rsquo;s down, you know; and I told the
Major I very much disliked it from the first.&nbsp; However, it
had to be said; and now it has been, and, between gentlemen, it
shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary to refer to it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s compromising; it doesn&rsquo;t lead to
anything; not the kind of man,&rsquo; I repeated
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I believe I understand, and shall
make haste to put myself <i>en r&egrave;gle</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
stood up, and laid my segar down.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Gilchrist,&rsquo; said I, with a bow, &lsquo;in answer to your
very natural observations, I beg to offer myself as a suitor for
your sister&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; I am a man of title, of which we
think lightly in France, but of ancient lineage, which is
everywhere prized.&nbsp; I can display thirty-two quarterings
without a blot.&nbsp; My expectations are certainly above the
average: I believe my uncle&rsquo;s income averages about thirty
thousand pounds, though I admit I was not careful to inform
myself.&nbsp; Put it anywhere between fifteen and fifty thousand;
it is certainly not less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All this is very easy to say,&rsquo; said Ronald, with
a pitying smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Unfortunately, these things are in
the air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&mdash;in Buckinghamshire,&rsquo; said I,
smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what I mean is, my dear St. Ives, that you
<i>can&rsquo;t prove</i> them,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They might just as well not be: do you follow me?&nbsp;
You can&rsquo;t bring us any third party to back you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, come!&rsquo; cried I, springing up and hurrying to
the table.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must excuse me!&rsquo;&nbsp; I wrote
Romaine&rsquo;s address.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is my reference, Mr.
Gilchrist.&nbsp; Until you have written to him, and received his
negative answer, I have a right to be treated, and I shall see
that you treat me, as a gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was brought up
with a round turn at that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, St. Ives,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Believe me, I had no wish to be offensive.&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s the difficulty of this affair; I can&rsquo;t make
any of my points without offence!&nbsp; You must excuse me,
it&rsquo;s not my fault.&nbsp; But, at any rate, you must see for
yourself this proposal of marriage is&mdash;is merely impossible,
my dear fellow.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nonsense!&nbsp; Our countries
are at war; you are a prisoner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My ancestor of the time of the Ligue,&rsquo; I replied,
&lsquo;married a Huguenot lady out of the Saintonge, riding two
hundred miles through an enemy&rsquo;s country to bring off his
bride; and it was a happy marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; he began; and then looked down into the
fire, and became silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s this business
of&mdash;Goguelat,&rsquo; said he, still looking at the coals in
the grate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; I exclaimed, starting in my chair.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This business about Goguelat,&rsquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ronald,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;this is not your
doing.&nbsp; These are not your own words.&nbsp; I know where
they came from: a coward put them in your mouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;St. Ives!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;why do you make it so
hard for me? and where&rsquo;s the use of insulting other
people?&nbsp; The plain English is, that I can&rsquo;t hear of
any proposal of marriage from a man under a charge like
that.&nbsp; You must see it for yourself, man!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the most absurd thing I ever heard of!&nbsp; And you go on
forcing me to argue with you, too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I have had an affair of honour which terminated
unhappily, you&mdash;a young soldier, or next-door to
it&mdash;refuse my offer?&nbsp; Do I understand you
aright?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear fellow!&rsquo; he wailed, &lsquo;of course you
can twist my words, if you like.&nbsp; You <i>say</i> it was an
affair of honour.&nbsp; Well, I can&rsquo;t, of course, tell you
that&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I mean, you must see that
that&rsquo;s just the point!&nbsp; Was it?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have the honour to inform you,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, other people say the reverse, you see!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They lie, Ronald, and I will prove it in
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The short and the long of it is, that any man who is so
unfortunate as to have such things said about him is not the man
to be my brother-in-law!&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know who will be my first witness at the
court?&nbsp; Arthur Chevenix!&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rsquo; he cried, rising from his
chair and beginning to pace outrageously about the room.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you mean, St. Ives?&nbsp; What is this
about?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like a dream, I declare!&nbsp; You made
an offer, and I have refused it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like it, I
don&rsquo;t want it; and whatever I did, or didn&rsquo;t,
wouldn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;my aunt wouldn&rsquo;t bear of it
anyway!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you take your answer, man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must remember, Ronald, that we are playing with
edged tools,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;An offer of marriage is
a delicate subject to handle.&nbsp; You have refused, and you
have justified your refusal by several statements: first, that I
was an impostor; second, that our countries were at war; and
third&mdash; No, I will speak,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you can
answer when I have done,&mdash;and third, that I had
dishonourably killed&mdash;or was said to have done so&mdash;the
man Goguelat.&nbsp; Now, my dear fellow, these are very awkward
grounds to be taking.&nbsp; From any one else&rsquo;s lips I need
scarce tell you how I should resent them; but my hands are
tied.&nbsp; I have so much gratitude to you, without talking of
the love I bear your sister, that you insult me, when you do so,
under the cover of a complete impunity.&nbsp; I must feel the
pain&mdash;and I do feel it acutely&mdash;I can do nothing to
protect myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had been anxious enough to
interrupt me in the beginning; but now, and after I had ceased,
he stood a long while silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;St. Ives,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;I think I had
better go away.&nbsp; This has been very irritating.&nbsp; I
never at all meant to say anything of the kind, and I apologise
to you.&nbsp; I have all the esteem for you that one gentleman
should have for another.&nbsp; I only meant to tell you&mdash;to
show you what had influenced my mind; and that, in short, the
thing was impossible.&nbsp; One thing you may be quite sure of: I
shall do nothing against you.&nbsp; Will you shake hands before I
go away?&rsquo; he blurted out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I agree with you&mdash;the
interview has been irritating.&nbsp; Let bygones be
bygones.&nbsp; Good-bye, Ronald.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, St. Ives!&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m heartily sorry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with that he was gone.</p>
<p>The windows of my own sitting-room looked towards the north;
but the entrance passage drew its light from the direction of the
square.&nbsp; Hence I was able to observe Ronald&rsquo;s
departure, his very disheartened gait, and the fact that he was
joined, about half-way, by no less a man than Major
Chevenix.&nbsp; At this, I could scarce keep from smiling; so
unpalatable an interview must be before the pair of them, and I
could hear their voices, clashing like crossed swords, in that
eternal antiphony of &lsquo;I told you,&rsquo; and &lsquo;I told
you not.&rsquo;&nbsp; Without doubt, they had gained very little
by their visit; but then I had gained less than nothing, and had
been bitterly dispirited into the bargain.&nbsp; Ronald had stuck
to his guns and refused me to the last.&nbsp; It was no news;
but, on the other hand, it could not be contorted into good
news.&nbsp; I was now certain that during my temporary absence in
France, all irons would be put into the fire, and the world
turned upside down, to make Flora disown the obtrusive Frenchman
and accept Chevenix.&nbsp; Without doubt she would resist these
instances: but the thought of them did not please me, and I felt
she should be warned and prepared for the battle.</p>
<p>It was no use to try and see her now, but I promised myself
early that evening to return to Swanston.&nbsp; In the meantime I
had to make all my preparations, and look the coming journey in
the face.&nbsp; Here in Edinburgh I was within four miles of the
sea, yet the business of approaching random fishermen with my hat
in the one hand and a knife in the other, appeared so desperate,
that I saw nothing for it but to retrace my steps over the
northern counties, and knock a second time at the doors of
Birchell Fenn.&nbsp; To do this, money would be necessary; and
after leaving my paper in the hands of Flora I had still a
balance of about fifteen hundred pounds.&nbsp; Or rather I may
say I had them and I had them not; for after my luncheon with Mr.
Robbie I had placed the amount, all but thirty pounds of change,
in a bank in George Street, on a deposit receipt in the name of
Mr. Rowley.&nbsp; This I had designed to be my gift to him, in
case I must suddenly depart.&nbsp; But now, thinking better of
the arrangement, I despatched my little man, cockade and all, to
lift the fifteen hundred.</p>
<p>He was not long gone, and returned with a flushed face, and
the deposit receipt still in his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No go, Mr. Anne,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; I inquired,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, I found the place all right, and no
mistake,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I tell you what gave me
a blue fright!&nbsp; There was a customer standing by the door,
and I reckonised him!&nbsp; Who do you think it was, Mr.
Anne?&nbsp; W&rsquo;y, that same Red-Breast&mdash;him I had
breakfast with near Aylesbury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sure you are not mistaken?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certain sure,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not Mr.
Lavender, I don&rsquo;t mean, sir; I mean the other party.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s he doing here?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; It
don&rsquo;t look right.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not by any means,&rsquo; I agreed.</p>
<p>I walked to and fro in the apartment reflecting.&nbsp; This
particular Bow Street runner might be here by accident; but it
was to imagine a singular play of coincidence that he, who had
met Rowley and spoken with him in the &lsquo;Green Dragon,&rsquo;
hard by Aylesbury, should be now in Scotland, where he could have
no legitimate business, and by the doors of the bank where Rowley
kept his account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rowley,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;he didn&rsquo;t see you,
did he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never a fear,&rsquo; quoth Rowley.&nbsp;
&lsquo;W&rsquo;y Mr. Anne, sir, if he &rsquo;ad, you
wouldn&rsquo;t have seen <i>me</i> any more!&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t
a hass, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my boy, you can put that receipt in your
pocket.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have no more use for it till
you&rsquo;re quite clear of me.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t lose it,
though; it&rsquo;s your share of the Christmas-box: fifteen
hundred pounds all for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Begging your pardon, Mr. Anne, sir, but wot for!&rsquo;
said Rowley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To set up a public-house upon,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir, I ain&rsquo;t got any
call to set up a public-house, sir,&rsquo; he replied
stoutly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I tell you wot, sir, it seems to me
I&rsquo;m reether young for the billet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m your body
servant, Mr. Anne, or else I&rsquo;m nothink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Rowley,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what it&rsquo;s for.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s for the good service you
have done me, of which I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;and don&rsquo;t
dare&mdash;to speak.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s for your loyalty and
cheerfulness, my dear boy.&nbsp; I had meant it for you; but to
tell you the truth, it&rsquo;s past mending now&mdash;it has to
be yours.&nbsp; Since that man is waiting by the bank, the money
can&rsquo;t be touched until I&rsquo;m gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Until you&rsquo;re gone, sir?&rsquo; re-echoed
Rowley.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t go anywheres without me, I
can tell you that, Mr. Anne, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my boy,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;we are going to part
very soon now; probably to-morrow.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s for my
sake, Rowley!&nbsp; Depend upon it, if there was any reason at
all for that Bow Street man being at the bank, he was not there
to look out for you.&nbsp; How they could have found out about
the account so early is more than I can fathom; some strange
coincidence must have played me false!&nbsp; But there the fact
is; and Rowley, I&rsquo;ll not only have to say farewell to you
presently, I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to stay indoors until I can
say it.&nbsp; Remember, my boy, it&rsquo;s only so that you can
serve me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;W&rsquo;y, sir, you say the word, and of course
I&rsquo;ll do it!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;&ldquo;Nothink by
&rsquo;alves,&rdquo; is my motto!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m your man,
through thick and thin, live or die, I am!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime there was nothing to be done till towards
sunset.&nbsp; My only chance now was to come again as quickly as
possible to speech of Flora, who was my only practicable banker;
and not before evening was it worth while to think of that.&nbsp;
I might compose myself as well as I was able over the
<i>Caledonian Mercury</i>, with its ill news of the campaign of
France and belated documents about the retreat from Russia; and,
as I sat there by the fire, I was sometimes all awake with anger
and mortification at what I was reading, and sometimes again I
would be three parts asleep as I dozed over the barren items of
home intelligence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lately arrived&rsquo;&mdash;this
is what I suddenly stumbled on&mdash;&lsquo;at Dumbreck&rsquo;s
Hotel, the Viscount of Saint-Yves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rowley,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, Mr. Anne, sir,&rsquo; answered the
obsequious, lowering his pipe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come and look at this, my boy,&rsquo; said I, holding
out the paper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My crikey!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
&rsquo;im, sir, sure enough!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure enough, Rowley,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s on the trail.&nbsp; He has fairly caught up
with us.&nbsp; He and this Bow Street man have come together, I
would swear.&nbsp; And now here is the whole field, quarry,
hounds and hunters, all together in this city of
Edinburgh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And wot are you goin&rsquo; to do now, sir?&nbsp; Tell
you wot, let me take it in &rsquo;and, please!&nbsp; Gimme a
minute, and I&rsquo;ll disguise myself, and go out to this Dum---
to this hotel, leastways, sir&mdash;and see wot he&rsquo;s up
to.&nbsp; You put your trust in me, Mr. Anne: I&rsquo;m fly,
don&rsquo;t you make no mistake about it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all
a-growing and a-blowing, I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not one foot of you,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
are a prisoner, Rowley, and make up your mind to that.&nbsp; So
am I, or next door to it.&nbsp; I showed it you for a caution; if
you go on the streets, it spells death to me, Rowley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, sir,&rsquo; says Rowley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come to think of it,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;you
must take a cold, or something.&nbsp; No good of awakening Mrs.
McRankine&rsquo;s suspicions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A cold?&rsquo; he cried, recovering immediately from
his depression.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can do it, Mr. Anne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he proceeded to sneeze and cough and blow his nose, till I
could not restrain myself from smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I tell you, I know a lot of them dodges,&rsquo; he
observed proudly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, they come in very handy,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d better go at once and show it to the old gal,
&rsquo;adn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>I told him, by all means; and he was gone upon the instant,
gleeful as though to a game of football.</p>
<p>I took up the paper and read carelessly on, my thoughts
engaged with my immediate danger, till I struck on the next
paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In connection with the recent horrid murder
in the Castle, we are desired to make public the following
intelligence.&nbsp; The soldier, Champdivers, is supposed to be
in the neighbourhood of this city.&nbsp; He is about the middle
height or rather under, of a pleasing appearance and highly
genteel address.&nbsp; When last heard of he wore a fashionable
suit of pearl-grey, and boots with fawn-coloured tops.&nbsp; He
is accompanied by a servant about sixteen years of age, speaks
English without any accent, and passed under the <i>alias</i> of
Ramornie.&nbsp; A reward is offered for his
apprehension.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a moment I was in the next room, stripping from me the
pearl-coloured suit!</p>
<p>I confess I was now a good deal agitated.&nbsp; It is
difficult to watch the toils closing slowly and surely about you,
and to retain your composure; and I was glad that Rowley was not
present to spy on my confusion.&nbsp; I was flushed, my breath
came thick; I cannot remember a time when I was more put out.</p>
<p>And yet I must wait and do nothing, and partake of my meals,
and entertain the ever-garrulous Rowley, as though I were
entirely my own man.&nbsp; And if I did not require to entertain
Mrs. McRankine also, that was but another drop of bitterness in
my cup!&nbsp; For what ailed my landlady, that she should hold
herself so severely aloof, that she should refuse conversation,
that her eyes should be reddened, that I should so continually
hear the voice of her private supplications sounding through the
house?&nbsp; I was much deceived, or she had read the insidious
paragraph and recognised the comminated pearl-grey suit.&nbsp; I
remember now a certain air with which she had laid the paper on
my table, and a certain sniff, between sympathy and defiance,
with which she had announced it: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s your
<i>Mercury</i> for ye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this direction, at least, I saw no pressing danger; her
tragic countenance betokened agitation; it was plain she was
wrestling with her conscience, and the battle still hung
dubious.&nbsp; The question of what to do troubled me
extremely.&nbsp; I could not venture to touch such an intricate
and mysterious piece of machinery as my landlady&rsquo;s
spiritual nature: it might go off at a word, and in any
direction, like a badly-made firework.&nbsp; And while I praised
myself extremely for my wisdom in the past, that I had made so
much a friend of her, I was all abroad as to my conduct in the
present.&nbsp; There seemed an equal danger in pressing and in
neglecting the accustomed marks of familiarity.&nbsp; The one
extreme looked like impudence, and might annoy, the other was a
practical confession of guilt.&nbsp; Altogether, it was a good
hour for me when the dusk began to fall in earnest on the streets
of Edinburgh, and the voice of an early watchman bade me set
forth.</p>
<p>I reached the neighbourhood of the cottage before seven; and
as I breasted the steep ascent which leads to the garden wall, I
was struck with surprise to hear a dog.&nbsp; Dogs I had heard
before, but only from the hamlet on the hillside above.&nbsp;
Now, this dog was in the garden itself, where it roared aloud in
paroxysms of fury, and I could hear it leaping and straining on
the chain.&nbsp; I waited some while, until the brute&rsquo;s fit
of passion had roared itself out.&nbsp; Then, with the utmost
precaution, I drew near again; and finally approached the garden
wall.&nbsp; So soon as I had clapped my head above the level,
however, the barking broke forth again with redoubled
energy.&nbsp; Almost at the same time, the door of the cottage
opened, and Ronald and the Major appeared upon the threshold with
a lantern.&nbsp; As they so stood, they were almost immediately
below me, strongly illuminated, and within easy earshot.&nbsp;
The Major pacified the dog, who took instead to low, uneasy
growling intermingled with occasional yelps.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good thing I brought Towzer!&rsquo; said Chevenix.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn him, I wonder where he is!&rsquo; said Ronald; and
he moved the lantern up and down, and turned the night into a
shifting puzzle-work of gleam and shadow.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think
I&rsquo;ll make a sally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will,&rsquo; replied
Chevenix.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I agreed to come out here and do
sentry-go, it was on one condition, Master Ronald: don&rsquo;t
you forget that!&nbsp; Military discipline, my boy!&nbsp; Our
beat is this path close about the house.&nbsp; Down, Towzer! good
boy, good boy&mdash;gently, then!&rsquo; he went on, caressing
his confounded monster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To think!&nbsp; The beggar may be hearing us this
minute!&rsquo; cried Ronald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing more probable,&rsquo; said the Major.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You there, St. Ives?&rsquo; he added, in a distinct but
guarded voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only want to tell you, you had
better go home.&nbsp; Mr. Gilchrist and I take watch and
watch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The game was up.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Beaucoup de
plaisir</i>!&rsquo; I replied, in the same tones.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Il fait un peu froid pour veiller</i>; <i>gardez-vous
des engelures</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I suppose it was done in a moment of ungovernable rage; but in
spite of the excellent advice he had given to Ronald the moment
before, Chevenix slipped the chain, and the dog sprang, straight
as an arrow, up the bank.&nbsp; I stepped back, picked up a stone
of about twelve pounds weight, and stood ready.&nbsp; With a
bound the beast landed on the cope-stone of the wall; and, almost
in the same instant, my missile caught him fair in the
face.&nbsp; He gave a stifled cry, went tumbling back where he
had come from, and I could hear the twelve-pounder accompany him
in his fall.&nbsp; Chevenix, at the same moment, broke out in a
roaring voice: &lsquo;The hell-hound!&nbsp; If he&rsquo;s killed
my dog!&rsquo; and I judged, upon all grounds, it was as well to
be off.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX&mdash;EVENTS OF WEDNESDAY; THE UNIVERSITY OF
CRAMOND</h2>
<p>I awoke to much diffidence, even to a feeling that might be
called the beginnings of panic, and lay for hours in my bed
considering the situation.&nbsp; Seek where I pleased, there was
nothing to encourage me and plenty to appal.&nbsp; They kept a
close watch about the cottage; they had a beast of a
watch-dog&mdash;at least, unless I had settled it; and if I had,
I knew its bereaved master would only watch the more
indefatigably for the loss.&nbsp; In the pardonable ostentation
of love I had given all the money I could spare to Flora; I had
thought it glorious that the hunted exile should come down, like
Jupiter, in a shower of gold, and pour thousands in the lap of
the beloved.&nbsp; Then I had in an hour of arrant folly buried
what remained to me in a bank in George Street.&nbsp; And now I
must get back the one or the other; and which? and how?</p>
<p>As I tossed in my bed, I could see three possible courses, all
extremely perilous.&nbsp; First, Rowley might have been mistaken;
the bank might not be watched; it might still be possible for him
to draw the money on the deposit receipt.&nbsp; Second, I might
apply again to Robbie.&nbsp; Or, third, I might dare everything,
go to the Assembly Ball, and speak with Flora under the eyes of
all Edinburgh.&nbsp; This last alternative, involving as it did
the most horrid risks, and the delay of forty-eight hours, I did
but glance at with an averted head, and turned again to the
consideration of the others.&nbsp; It was the likeliest thing in
the world that Robbie had been warned to have no more to do with
me. The whole policy of the Gilchrists was in the hands of
Chevenix; and I thought this was a precaution so elementary that
he was certain to have taken it.&nbsp; If he had not, of course I
was all right: Robbie would manage to communicate with Flora; and
by four o&rsquo;clock I might be on the south road and, I was
going to say, a free man.&nbsp; Lastly, I must assure myself with
my own eyes whether the bank in George Street were
beleaguered.</p>
<p>I called to Rowley and questioned him tightly as to the
appearance of the Bow Street officer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What sort of looking man is he, Rowley?&rsquo; I asked,
as I began to dress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wot sort of a looking man he is?&rsquo; repeated
Rowley.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t very well know wot you
would say, Mr. Anne.&nbsp; He ain&rsquo;t a beauty,
any&rsquo;ow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he tall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tall?&nbsp; Well, no, I shouldn&rsquo;t say <i>tall</i>
Mr. Anne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, is he short?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Short?&nbsp; No, I don&rsquo;t think I would say he was
what you would call <i>short</i>.&nbsp; No, not piticular short,
sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, I suppose, he must be about the middle
height?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you might say it, sir; but not remarkable
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I smothered an oath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he clean-shaved?&rsquo; I tried him again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clean-shaved?&rsquo; he repeated, with the same air of
anxious candour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heaven, man, don&rsquo;t repeat my words like a
parrot!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell me what the man was
like: it is of the first importance that I should be able to
recognise him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m trying to, Mr. Anne.&nbsp; But
<i>clean-shaved</i>?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t seem to rightly get hold
of that p&rsquo;int.&nbsp; Sometimes it might appear to me like
as if he was; and sometimes like as if he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; No,
it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me now if you was to tell me he
&rsquo;ad a bit o&rsquo; whisker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was the man red-faced?&rsquo; I roared, dwelling on
each syllable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need go for to get cross about
it, Mr. Anne!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
tellin&rsquo; you every blessed thing I see!&nbsp;
Red-faced?&nbsp; Well, no, not as you would remark
upon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A dreadful calm fell upon me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was he anywise pale?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it don&rsquo;t seem to me as though he
were.&nbsp; But I tell you truly, I didn&rsquo;t take much heed
to that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he look like a drinking man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no.&nbsp; If you please, sir, he looked more like
an eating one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he was stout, was he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t go so far as
that.&nbsp; No, he wasn&rsquo;t not to say <i>stout</i>.&nbsp; If
anything, lean rather.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I need not go on with the infuriating interview.&nbsp; It
ended as it began, except that Rowley was in tears, and that I
had acquired one fact.&nbsp; The man was drawn for me as being of
any height you like to mention, and of any degree of corpulence
or leanness; clean-shaved or not, as the case might be; the
colour of his hair Rowley &lsquo;could not take it upon himself
to put a name on&rsquo;; that of his eyes he thought to have been
blue&mdash;nay, it was the one point on which he attained to a
kind of tearful certainty.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take my davy
on it,&rsquo; he asseverated.&nbsp; They proved to have been as
black as sloes, very little and very near together.&nbsp; So much
for the evidence of the artless!&nbsp; And the fact, or rather
the facts, acquired?&nbsp; Well, they had to do not with the
person but with his clothing.&nbsp; The man wore knee-breeches
and white stockings; his coat was &lsquo;some kind of a lightish
colour&mdash;or betwixt that and dark&rsquo;; and he wore a
&lsquo;mole-skin weskit.&rsquo;&nbsp; As if this were not enough,
he presently haled me from my breakfast in a prodigious flutter,
and showed me an honest and rather venerable citizen passing in
the Square.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s <i>him</i>, sir,&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;the very moral of him!&nbsp; Well, this one is better
dressed, and p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps a trifler taller; and in the
face he don&rsquo;t favour him noways at all, sir.&nbsp; No, not
when I come to look again, &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t seem to favour
him noways.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jackass!&rsquo; said I, and I think the greatest
stickler for manners will admit the epithet to have been
justified.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the appearance of my landlady added a great load of
anxiety to what I already suffered.&nbsp; It was plain that she
had not slept; equally plain that she had wept copiously.&nbsp;
She sighed, she groaned, she drew in her breath, she shook her
head, as she waited on table.&nbsp; In short, she seemed in so
precarious a state, like a petard three times charged with
hysteria, that I did not dare to address her; and stole out of
the house on tiptoe, and actually ran downstairs, in the fear
that she might call me back.&nbsp; It was plain that this degree
of tension could not last long.</p>
<p>It was my first care to go to George Street, which I reached
(by good luck) as a boy was taking down the bank shutters.&nbsp;
A man was conversing with him; he had white stockings and a
moleskin waistcoat, and was as ill-looking a rogue as you would
want to see in a day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; This seemed to agree
fairly well with Rowley&rsquo;s <i>signalement</i>: he had
declared emphatically (if you remember), and had stuck to it
besides, that the companion of the great Lavender was no
beauty.</p>
<p>Thence I made my way to Mr. Robbie&rsquo;s, where I rang the
bell.&nbsp; A servant answered the summons, and told me the
lawyer was engaged, as I had half expected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wha shall I say was callin&rsquo;?&rsquo; she pursued;
and when I had told her &lsquo;Mr. Ducie,&rsquo; &lsquo;I think
this&rsquo;ll be for you, then?&rsquo; she added, and handed me a
letter from the hall table.&nbsp; It ran:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr.
Ducie</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;My single advice to you is to leave <i>quam primum</i>
for the South.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, <span class="smcap">T.
Robbie</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was short and sweet.&nbsp; It emphatically extinguished
hope in one direction.&nbsp; No more was to be gotten of Robbie;
and I wondered, from my heart, how much had been told him.&nbsp;
Not too much, I hoped, for I liked the lawyer who had thus
deserted me, and I placed a certain reliance in the discretion of
Chevenix.&nbsp; He would not be merciful; on the other hand, I
did not think he would be cruel without cause.</p>
<p>It was my next affair to go back along George Street, and
assure myself whether the man in the moleskin vest was still on
guard.&nbsp; There was no sign of him on the pavement.&nbsp;
Spying the door of a common stair nearly opposite the bank, I
took it in my head that this would be a good point of
observation, crossed the street, entered with a businesslike air
and fell immediately against the man in the moleskin vest.&nbsp;
I stopped and apologised to him; he replied in an unmistakable
English accent, thus putting the matter almost beyond
doubt.&nbsp; After this encounter I must, of course, ascend to
the top story, ring the bell of a suite of apartments, inquire
for Mr. Vavasour, learn (with no great surprise) that he did not
live there, come down again and, again politely saluting the man
from Bow Street, make my escape at last into the street.</p>
<p>I was now driven back upon the Assembly Ball.&nbsp; Robbie had
failed me.&nbsp; The bank was watched; it would never do to risk
Rowley in that neighbourhood.&nbsp; All I could do was to wait
until the morrow evening, and present myself at the Assembly, let
it end as it might.&nbsp; But I must say I came to this decision
with a good deal of genuine fright; and here I came for the first
time to one of those places where my courage stuck.&nbsp; I do
not mean that my courage boggled and made a bit of a bother over
it, as it did over the escape from the Castle; I mean, stuck,
like a stopped watch or a dead man.&nbsp; Certainly I would go to
the ball; certainly I must see this morning about my
clothes.&nbsp; That was all decided.&nbsp; But the most of the
shops were on the other side of the valley, in the Old Town; and
it was now my strange discovery that I was physically unable to
cross the North Bridge!&nbsp; It was as though a precipice had
stood between us, or the deep sea had intervened.&nbsp; Nearer to
the Castle my legs refused to bear me.</p>
<p>I told myself this was mere superstition; I made wagers with
myself&mdash;and gained them; I went down on the esplanade of
Princes Street, walked and stood there, alone and conspicuous,
looking across the garden at the old grey bastions of the
fortress, where all these troubles had begun.&nbsp; I cocked my
hat, set my hand on my hip, and swaggered on the pavement,
confronting detection.&nbsp; And I found I could do all this with
a sense of exhilaration that was not unpleasing, and with a
certain <i>cr&acirc;nerie</i> of manner that raised me in my own
esteem.&nbsp; And yet there was one thing I could not bring my
mind to face up to, or my limbs to execute; and that was to cross
the valley into the Old Town.&nbsp; It seemed to me I must be
arrested immediately if I had done so; I must go straight into
the twilight of a prison cell, and pass straight thence to the
gross and final embraces of the nightcap and the halter.&nbsp;
And yet it was from no reasoned fear of the consequences that I
could not go.&nbsp; I was unable.&nbsp; My horse baulked, and
there was an end!</p>
<p>My nerve was gone: here was a discovery for a man in such
imminent peril, set down to so desperate a game, which I could
only hope to win by continual luck and unflagging
effrontery!&nbsp; The strain had been too long continued, and my
nerve was gone.&nbsp; I fell into what they call panic fear, as I
have seen soldiers do on the alarm of a night attack, and turned
out of Princes Street at random as though the devil were at my
heels.&nbsp; In St. Andrew Square, I remember vaguely hearing
some one call out.&nbsp; I paid no heed, but pressed on
blindly.&nbsp; A moment after, a hand fell heavily on my
shoulder, and I thought I had fainted.&nbsp; Certainly the world
went black about me for some seconds; and when that spasm passed
I found myself standing face to face with the &lsquo;cheerful
extravagant,&rsquo; in what sort of disarray I really dare not
imagine, dead white at least, shaking like an aspen, and mowing
at the man with speechless lips.&nbsp; And this was the soldier
of Napoleon, and the gentleman who intended going next night to
an Assembly Ball!&nbsp; I am the more particular in telling of my
breakdown, because it was my only experience of the sort; and it
is a good tale for officers.&nbsp; I will allow no man to call me
coward; I have made my proofs; few men more.&nbsp; And yet I
(come of the best blood in France and inured to danger from a
child) did, for some ten or twenty minutes, make this hideous
exhibition of myself on the streets of the New Town of
Edinburgh.</p>
<p>With my first available breath I begged his pardon.&nbsp; I
was of an extremely nervous disposition, recently increased by
late hours; I could not bear the slightest start.</p>
<p>He seemed much concerned.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must be in a devil
of a state!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;though of course it was my
fault&mdash;damnably silly, vulgar sort of thing to do!&nbsp; A
thousand apologies!&nbsp; But you really must be run down; you
should consult a medico.&nbsp; My dear sir, a hair of the dog
that bit you is clearly indicated.&nbsp; A touch of Blue Ruin,
now?&nbsp; Or, come: it&rsquo;s early, but is man the slave of
hours? what do you say to a chop and a bottle in Dumbreck&rsquo;s
Hotel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I refused all false comfort; but when he went on to remind me
that this was the day when the University of Cramond met; and to
propose a five-mile walk into the country and a dinner in the
company of young asses like himself, I began to think
otherwise.&nbsp; I had to wait until to-morrow evening, at any
rate; this might serve as well as anything else to bridge the
dreary hours.&nbsp; The country was the very place for me: and
walking is an excellent sedative for the nerves.&nbsp;
Remembering poor Rowley, feigning a cold in our lodgings and
immediately under the guns of the formidable and now doubtful
Bethiah, I asked if I might bring my servant.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor
devil! it is dull for him,&rsquo; I explained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The merciful man is merciful to his ass,&rsquo;
observed my sententious friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bring him by all
means!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The harp, his sole remaining joy,<br />
Was carried by an orphan boy;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I have no doubt the orphan boy can get some cold victuals
in the kitchen, while the Senatus dines.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, being now quite recovered from my unmanly
condition, except that nothing could yet induce me to cross the
North Bridge, I arranged for my ball dress at a shop in Leith
Street, where I was not served ill, cut out Rowley from his
seclusion, and was ready along with him at the trysting-place,
the corner of Duke Street and York Place, by a little after
two.&nbsp; The University was represented in force: eleven
persons, including ourselves, Byfield the aeronaut, and the tall
lad, Forbes, whom I had met on the Sunday morning, bedewed with
tallow, at the &lsquo;Hunters&rsquo; Rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was
introduced; and we set off by way of Newhaven and the sea beach;
at first through pleasant country roads, and afterwards along a
succession of bays of a fairylike prettiness, to our
destination&mdash;Cramond on the Almond&mdash;a little hamlet on
a little river, embowered in woods, and looking forth over a
great flat of quicksand to where a little islet stood planted in
the sea.&nbsp; It was miniature scenery, but charming of its
kind.&nbsp; The air of this good February afternoon was bracing,
but not cold.&nbsp; All the way my companions were skylarking,
jesting and making puns, and I felt as if a load had been taken
off my lungs and spirits, and skylarked with the best of
them.</p>
<p>Byfield I observed, because I had heard of him before, and
seen his advertisements, not at all because I was disposed to
feel interest in the man.&nbsp; He was dark and bilious and very
silent; frigid in his manners, but burning internally with a
great fire of excitement; and he was so good as to bestow a good
deal of his company and conversation (such as it was) upon
myself, who was not in the least grateful.&nbsp; If I had known
how I was to be connected with him in the immediate future, I
might have taken more pains.</p>
<p>In the hamlet of Cramond there is a hostelry of no very
promising appearance, and here a room had been prepared for us,
and we sat down to table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here you will find no guttling or gormandising, no
turtle or nightingales&rsquo; tongues,&rsquo; said the
extravagant, whose name, by the way, was Dalmahoy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The device, sir, of the University of Cramond is Plain
Living and High Drinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Grace was said by the Professor of Divinity, in a macaronic
Latin, which I could by no means follow, only I could hear it
rhymed, and I guessed it to be more witty than reverent.&nbsp;
After which the <i>Senatus Academicus</i> sat down to rough
plenty in the shape of rizzar&rsquo;d haddocks and mustard, a
sheep&rsquo;s head, a haggis, and other delicacies of
Scotland.&nbsp; The dinner was washed down with brown stout in
bottle, and as soon as the cloth was removed, glasses, boiling
water, sugar, and whisky were set out for the manufacture of
toddy.&nbsp; I played a good knife and fork, did not shun the
bowl, and took part, so far as I was able, in the continual fire
of pleasantry with which the meal was seasoned.&nbsp; Greatly
daring, I ventured, before all these Scotsmen, to tell
Sim&rsquo;s Tale of Tweedie&rsquo;s dog; and I was held to have
done such extraordinary justice to the dialect, &lsquo;for a
Southron,&rsquo; that I was immediately voted into the Chair of
Scots, and became, from that moment, a full member of the
University of Cramond.&nbsp; A little after, I found myself
entertaining them with a song; and a little after&mdash;perhaps a
little in consequence&mdash;it occurred to me that I had had
enough, and would be very well inspired to take French
leave.&nbsp; It was not difficult to manage, for it was
nobody&rsquo;s business to observe my movements, and conviviality
had banished suspicion.</p>
<p>I got easily forth of the chamber, which reverberated with the
voices of these merry and learned gentlemen, and breathed a long
breath.&nbsp; I had passed an agreeable afternoon and evening,
and I had apparently escaped scot free.&nbsp; Alas! when I looked
into the kitchen, there was my monkey, drunk as a lord, toppling
on the edge of the dresser, and performing on the flageolet to an
audience of the house lasses and some neighbouring ploughmen.</p>
<p>I routed him promptly from his perch, stuck his hat on, put
his instrument in his pocket, and set off with him for
Edinburgh.</p>
<p>His limbs were of paper, his mind quite in abeyance; I must
uphold and guide him, prevent his frantic dives, and set him
continually on his legs again.&nbsp; At first he sang wildly,
with occasional outbursts of causeless laughter.&nbsp; Gradually
an inarticulate melancholy succeeded; he wept gently at times;
would stop in the middle of the road, say firmly &lsquo;No, no,
no,&rsquo; and then fall on his back: or else address me solemnly
as &lsquo;M&rsquo;lord&rsquo; and fall on his face by way of
variety.&nbsp; I am afraid I was not always so gentle with the
little pig as I might have been, but really the position was
unbearable.&nbsp; We made no headway at all, and I suppose we
were scarce gotten a mile away from Cramond, when the whole
<i>Senatus Academicus</i> was heard hailing, and doubling the
pace to overtake its.</p>
<p>Some of them were fairly presentable; and they were all
Christian martyrs compared to Rowley; but they were in a
frolicsome and rollicking humour that promised danger as we
approached the town.&nbsp; They sang songs, they ran races, they
fenced with their walking-sticks and umbrellas; and, in spite of
this violent exercise, the fun grew only the more extravagant
with the miles they traversed.&nbsp; Their drunkenness was
deep-seated and permanent, like fire in a peat; or
rather&mdash;to be quite just to them&mdash;it was not so much to
be called drunkenness at all, as the effect of youth and high
spirits&mdash;a fine night, and the night young, a good road
under foot, and the world before you!</p>
<p>I had left them once somewhat unceremoniously; I could not
attempt it a second time; and, burthened as I was with Mr.
Rowley, I was really glad of assistance.&nbsp; But I saw the
lamps of Edinburgh draw near on their hill-top with a good deal
of uneasiness, which increased, after we had entered the lighted
streets, to positive alarm.&nbsp; All the passers-by were
addressed, some of them by name.&nbsp; A worthy man was stopped
by Forbes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;in the name
of the Senatus of the University of Cramond, I confer upon you
the degree of LL.D.,&rsquo; and with the words he bonneted
him.&nbsp; Conceive the predicament of St. Ives, committed to the
society of these outrageous youths, in a town where the police
and his cousin were both looking for him!&nbsp; So far, we had
pursued our way unmolested, although raising a clamour fit to
wake the dead; but at last, in Abercromby Place, I
believe&mdash;at least it was a crescent of highly respectable
houses fronting on a garden&mdash;Byfield and I, having fallen
somewhat in the rear with Rowley, came to a simultaneous
halt.&nbsp; Our ruffians were beginning to wrench off bells and
door-plates!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I say!&rsquo; says Byfield, &lsquo;this is too much
of a good thing!&nbsp; Confound it, I&rsquo;m a respectable
man&mdash;a public character, by George!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
afford to get taken up by the police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My own case exactly,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, let&rsquo;s bilk them,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>And we turned back and took our way down hill again.</p>
<p>It was none too soon: voices and alarm bells sounded; watchmen
here and there began to spring their rattles; it was plain the
University of Cramond would soon be at blows with the police of
Edinburgh!&nbsp; Byfield and I, running the semi-inanimate Rowley
before us, made good despatch, and did not stop till we were
several streets away, and the hubbub was already softened by
distance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;we are well out of
that!&nbsp; Did ever any one see such a pack of young
barbarians?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are properly punished, Mr. Byfield; we had no
business there,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed, sir, you may well say that!&nbsp;
Outrageous!&nbsp; And my ascension announced for Friday, you
know!&rsquo; cried the aeronaut.&nbsp; &lsquo;A pretty
scandal!&nbsp; Byfield the aeronaut at the police-court!&nbsp;
Tut-tut!&nbsp; Will you be able to get your rascal home,
sir?&nbsp; Allow me to offer you my card.&nbsp; I am staying at
Walker and Poole&rsquo;s Hotel, sir, where I should be pleased to
see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The pleasure would be mutual, sir,&rsquo; said I, but I
must say my heart was not in my words, and as I watched Mr.
Byfield departing I desired nothing less than to pursue the
acquaintance</p>
<p>One more ordeal remained for me to pass.&nbsp; I carried my
senseless load upstairs to our lodging, and was admitted by the
landlady in a tall white nightcap and with an expression
singularly grim.&nbsp; She lighted us into the sitting-room;
where, when I had seated Rowley in a chair, she dropped me a
cast-iron courtesy.&nbsp; I smelt gunpowder on the woman.&nbsp;
Her voice, tottered with emotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I give ye nottice, Mr. Ducie,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dacent folks&rsquo; houses . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>And at that apparently temper cut off her utterance, and she
took herself off without more words.</p>
<p>I looked about me at the room, the goggling Rowley, the
extinguished fire; my mind reviewed the laughable incidents of
the day and night; and I laughed out loud to myself&mdash;lonely
and cheerless laughter!.......</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
